			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As  professional web builders we know that the web is constantly changing and our methods and practices must respond and adapt as well. </p>
<p>There are so many new disciplines web professionals need to be know about, if not specizlized in, that weren&#8217;t around ten or even five years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always easy to keep on the latest and greatest in web and mobile tips, tricks and techniques. </p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s downright difficult.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s hard to keep up with the changes as professionals, so it must be even more so for our teachers of the craft. </p>
<h2 id="interactcurriculum">InterACT Curriculum</h2>
<p>For the past several years, a group of dedicated and talented volunteers have been working to help fix that.</p>
<p>Our Education Task Force has developed a world-class curriculum &#8211; we&#8217;re talking about tools for teaching. </p>
<p>Materials such as syllabii, quiz questions, recommended readings, and more aid in creating web professionals that are ready for the job market that so desperately needs young, competent web builders.</p>
<p>With such a strident resource, professors, educators to teach standards-based web design and development in their own classrooms. </p>
<p>Available on our web site, <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project InterACT Curriculum</a>  have found their way into some forward-thinking classrooms all over the world. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s totally free. </p>
<h2 id="webstandardstextbook">Web Standards&#8217; Textbook</h2>
<p>In addition, the Education Task Force published a textbook based off the curriculum titled <a href="http://interactwithwebstandards.com/">InterACT with Web Standards</a>. </p>
<p>This web standards textbook is a available from Peachpit, which has published classics such as Jeffrey Zeldman and Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s  <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321616952">Designing with Web Standards</a> and Dave Shea and Molly E. Holzschlag&#8217;s <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321303474">The Zen of CSS Design</a>. </p>
<h2 id="interactandw3cjoinforces">InterACT and W3C Join Forces</h2>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m happy to announce that the curriculum reaches even more people than ever before. </p>
<p>The  InterACT Curriculum developed through Web Standards Educational Task Force has been licensed to <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>.</p>
<p>Through their resources and network, the curriculum will be used to teach companies and organizations, large and super-large, about standards-based education.</p>
<p>And it only seems appropriate that InterACT finds yet another home that is the W3C. </p>
<p>The Educational Task Force&#8217;s InterACT was one of the primary catalytics that led to the formation of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Interact/WaSP">Open Web Education Alliance (OWEA)</a> under the W3C.</p>
<h2 id="weneedyourhelp">We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>To continue to expand the curriculum, the Education Task Force needs <em>your</em> help. </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be a self-proclaimed web guru or a mobile ninja to help. </p>
<p>We people that specialize in all facets of web and mobile design and development that includes copywriters, content strategists, user experts, project managers, and more.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s room for everyone and, frankly, it has been and will continue to be people like yourself <em>reading this message right now</em> that will make world-caliber educational material.</p>
<h2 id="jointheteam">Join the Team</h2>
<p>Contribute to a curriculum that gets in the hands of tomorrow&#8217;s builders today.</p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/contribute/">contribution form</a> or reach out to EduTF leaders,  <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/goodwitch/">Glenda Sims</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mark_dubois">Mark DuBois</a> to ask how you can get more involved.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In which we ask that the W3C to come up with a new monicker for the umbrella of modern web technologies.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today brings to us the news that the W3C have unveiled <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">a logo for HTML5</a>. Does an open technology <em>need</em> a logo? Perhaps not, but many see it as a good idea, including myself. I think it is a great idea to create a rallying flag/focus point for people to  use to show their support of HTML5, and to help increase awareness and propagation of this important new technology, thereby aiding the evolution of the open web.</p>
<p>But wait, things are not quite right. If you delve deeper you&#8217;ll see that, included in their definition of <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/#the-technology">the technology that comprises HTML5</a>, is CSS3, <abbr title="Web Open Font Format">WOFF</abbr>, SVG, and a few other cuckoos in the HTML5 nest. If you look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html">HTML5 Logo FAQ</a>, you&#8217;ll find the following:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html"><p>The logo is a general-purpose visual identity for a broad set of open web technologies, including HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t good—I appreciate that it is good to have an umbrella term for a group of related technologies and techniques that would otherwise be difficult to talk about in conversation. &#8220;Ajax&#8221; and &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; serve that purpose well. And it is ok to talk about closely-related specs such as <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html">Geolocation</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">Web Sockets</a> as being under the HTML5 umbrella, as long as you clarify it somewhere (you can find a good example in <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/get-familiar-with-html5/">Get familiar with HTML5!</a>). But this is different—HTML5 and CSS3, for example, are two distinctly different technologies, and should not be confused with one another. To do so will impede learning and cause problems with development, documentation, and all manner of other things.</p>
<p>You could perhaps forgive marketers for getting it confused, but then again their confusion is not so critical as long as their end product looks and works great, and they have a web developer behind them to put them right at critical points. But I have talked to many <strong>web developers</strong> that are confused, and honestly think that CSS3 and SVG are part of HTML5.</p>
<p>There has understandably been some bad feeling about this in the web community. Jeremy Keith put it nicely in <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><q>Badge of Shame</q></a>, and Bruce Lawson also gave a good view in <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/on-the-html5-logo/">On the HTML5 logo</a>, as well as providing a good rant to put things straight: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEncpCDEBI">HTML5 != CSS3</a>. At Opera, my colleagues and I are constantly reiterating a more accurate definition of HTML5 to help overcome such confusion, and many allies at other browser vendors are doing the same.</p>
<p>But standing against the W3C is not the way to solve this either. In light of this, we at the WaSP are sending an open letter to folks at the W3C, urging them to fix this oversight. The letter is thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear W3C,</p>
<p>We are writing to address a major concern we at WaSP (and in the web professional community in general) have with the newly-unveiled HTML5 brand. While we are excited that the W3C is doing so much to promote new technologies being developed, we are incredibly concerned that using &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as the umbrella for these technologies does more harm than good.</p>
<p>&#8220;HTML5,&#8221; as a term, has become a bit of a beast and is already presenting problems:</p>
<p>First, you’ve got HTML5 &#8220;the spec&#8221; which isn&#8217;t just HTML markup anymore, but includes specifications for everything from local databases to web workers. Explaining what we mean when we talk about &#8220;HTML5&#8221; requires use of modifying phrases, as in &#8220;HTML5 the markup language&#8221; or &#8220;HTML5 geolocation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then Apple and Google began promoting the use of &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as as a catch-all term for marketing their browser advancements, much as Microsoft and Netscape (and journalists) had used &#8220;DHTML&#8221; in the past. The term became less meaningful because it was being used to cover more ground and, consequently, it made communications between developers and clients more difficult because both sides did not have the same understanding of what HTML5 meant.</p>
<p>Now the W3C has come out and essentially condoned the branding of everything from CSS to actual HTML5 to WOFF as &#8220;HTML5&#8221;. We can&#8217;t imagine a single action that will cause more confusion than this misguided decision (and the W3C has produced some pretty impenetrable specs in its time). Our own Jeremy Keith summed it up perfectly when he said</p>
<blockquote cite="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><p>What we have here is a deliberate attempt to further blur the lines between separate technologies that have already become intertwingled in media reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need for the W3C, as a standards body, to understand the importance of clarity with regard to the term &#8220;HTML5&#8221;. Without being able to draw clear distinctions between technologies, clear communication about those technologies becomes increasingly difficult if not impossible. As an organization of web professionals promoting the inclusion of web standards in the education of future web professionals and the adoption of web standards among practicing professionals, we are deeply concerned that your decision will make our job even harder.</p>
<p>So, when push comes to shove, what do we want you to change? Well, we think a good place to start is backing away from the use of &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as a catch-all term. If you feel you need a catch-all term, come up with something else, but as Jeremy also said</p>
<blockquote cite="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><p>We [developers] never needed a term to refer to &#8220;XHTML 1.0 plus CSS2.1&#8221; or &#8220;HTML4.01 plus JavaScript&#8221; or &#8220;any combination of front-end technologies.&#8221; Why this sudden all-conquering need for a term that covers so many different technologies as to be completely meaningless?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a new moniker for the umbrella of modern web technologies, the blurred distinction between the diverse languages and systems that comprise it will evaporate and we won&#8217;t have to worry (as much) about the potential for miscommunication. Hey, it will even give you a chance to create another logo.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>The Web Standards Project</p>
</blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2010/02/02/reaching-out-to-small-businesses/">Back in February</a>, I announced that one of WaSP&#8217;s new efforts was going to be in the direction of outreach to small businesses. Since that time, things have looked pretty quiet from the outside, but the Small Business Outreach Committee has actually been quite busy gathering materials and putting together our first document which aims to help small business owners evaluate the competencies of those seeking to do web work for them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of a handful of WaSP members and a cadre of other web professionals, we&#8217;re making great progress. We&#8217;ve just wrapped up the material organization phase and are beginning to work on drafting the document, which we hope to have out before the end of the year. We&#8217;re also in the process of putting together a website to house &#8220;living&#8221; versions of the materials we produce and assist with the promotion and distribution of this document and any others we generate in the future.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll post further announcements on this project as we get closer to the launch date.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[You may have noticed that the InterACT curriculum team recently released its first book: <a href="http://interactwithwebstandards.com">InterACT With Web Standards: A Holistic Approach to Web Design</a>. It is the first book released by WaSP, and it directly ties into the work that the Education Task Force and other contributors have put into the courses in the <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">InterACT curriculum</a>.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>InterACT with Web Standards isn&#8217;t a paper copy (or ebook copy) of the online curriculum in textbook format but rather it takes the same motivations and wisdom that goes into the online material and creates a new tool for those trying to learn or teach the profession of building web sites in an educational setting or to the those learning in their own.</p>
<p>From my seat on the sidelines of the book project I found it to be one of those rare gem that provides insight from a variety of working professionals on the topics they know best &#8212; from content creation to markup to accessibility &#8212; all along the way teaching the fundamentals and craft that goes into building successful web sites. While the middle third of the book covers page building with HTML and CSS it is surrounded by discussion of topics from strategy to marketing to accessibility to something so many technical books leave off &#8212; how to use the web to keep learning about the web as it evolves.</p>
<p>That is the core of why I&#8217;m loving seeing the work the authors have done with this book and with the <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">WaSP InterACT Curriculum</a>. Education, be it in higher education settings, professional and business settings or those self educating, in our fast moving and always changing field <strong>has</strong> to cover these fundamentals and core principles as much as it is about current coding techniques or the current crop of browsers or devices. The authors, many of whom have been in the business for a decade or more, have built up knowledge of these fundamentals and work hard to pass them onto the reader.</p>
<p>Information about InterAct with Web Standards and its authors is available on the <a href="http://interactwithwebstandards.com/">book&#8217;s companion website</a>. It is worth noting that 25% of author proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated to the <a href="http://openwebeducation.org/">Open Web Education Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>This Friday, June 11, many of the authors are participating in an <a href="http://interactsummit.eventbrite.com/">online book launch event and conference</a>. Though it is sold out, if you sign up for the waiting list you&#8217;ll be informed when tapings if the event are available.</p>
<p>Finally, you can read up on and support the curriculum initiatives at the <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">WaSP InterACT Curriculum</a>, support the Open Web Education Alliance win a grant with your <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/project/open-web-education-alliance">vote on Drumbeat</a>, or check out the <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Today, six more essential courses join the WaSP InterACT curriculum to help schools prepare their students for a career working on the Web.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was just one year ago that The WaSP released its open curriculum project <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org">InterACT</a> designed to help educators roll web standards and industry best practices into their courses. InterACT debuted at <acronym title="South By Southwest Interactive">SxSWi</acronym> 2009 with eleven courses created by a host of veteran educators and industry pros. Today, six more essential courses (that&#8217;s seventeen courses in total now if you&#8217;re counting) join our living curriculum to help schools prepare their students for a career working on the Web.<span id="more-1849"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/foundation/writing-for-the-web/?overview">Writing for the Web</a>, author: Erin Kissane</li>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/user-science/usability-1/?overview">Usability 1</a>, authors: Dara Solomon and Dana Wortman</li>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/user-science/prototyping/?overview">Prototyping</a>, authors: Todd Zaki Warfel and Aarron Walter</li>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/professional-practice/project-management/?overview">Project Management</a>, authors:  Stephanie Troeth and Denise Jacobs</li>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/serve-side-dev/server-side-scripting-1/?overview">Server-side Scripting</a>, author: Lars Gunther</li>
<li><a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/user-science/interaction-design-1/?overview">Interaction Design 1</a>, authors: Carolyn Chandler and Jason Ulaszek</li>
</ul>
<p>As is true of all InterACT courses, these six new courses contain competencies (the stuff students need to master in order to pass the class), assignments with grading rubrics, exam questions, recommended texts and readings, and technologies required to teach the course.</p>
<p>Though we&#8217;ve spent hundreds of hours developing these courses, we know the hardest work is still ahead. We need your help to get these courses into high schools, and colleges around the world. If you are an educator, use these courses (they are free and <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/terms/">licensed under Creative Commons</a>). If you are a student, tell your teachers about InterACT (gold star for you!). If you are an industry pro, connect with a local school to let them know about InterACT, or better yet, give a short presentation on web standards in the real world. Regardless of your connection to web education, you can help move the cause forward with a tweet, a blog post, or a conversation with a colleague.</p>
<p>These six courses are just a piece of what InterACT is working on. Stay tuned.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In an effort to increase adoption of web standards, we're going to try something new.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of you are probably wondering where the WaSP of the late ’90s or even the early ’00s has gone. Where are the actions? Where is the advocacy? Who should we be mad at today?</p>
<p>The truth is that this organization is evolving. For the last two years, a large amount of our focus has been placed on education, realized in our creation of <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org">the InterAct curriculum framework</a> and the birth of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/owea/">Open Web Education Alliance</a>. With the lion&#8217;s share of our talent and energy devoted to these efforts, things have been noticeably quiet on this blog, but that&#8217;s not an excuse&#8230;we can and should be doing more to promote the understanding and use of web standards. After all that&#8217;s what we were formed to do.</p>
<p>For the last two or three years, WaSP&#8217;s relevance has definitely diminished. With a few exceptions, browsers are doing a darn good job of promoting standards. Techniques we championed, such as Unobtrusive JavaScript and Progressive Enhancement, have become engrained in the methodology of many great web agencies and in-house web teams. In many ways, it seems WaSP has won the war for web standards, but has it really? There are still a ton of small web companies and small to mid-sized businesses building websites with little or no regard for cross-browser /cross-device compatibility. Inaccessible sites and applications, especially in this age of Ajax, seem to pop up every few seconds.</p>
<p>These projects have been put together by web designers and developers we&#8217;ve never reached and, for the last few years, we&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to change that. Sure, our education effort is a logical means of teaching the next generation of web designers and developers to do things the Right Way™, but what of the practicing professionals who either have not been exposed to web standards or have been reluctant to upgrade their skill set? How do we reach them?</p>
<p>One way we hope to move this group in the right direction is by doing an end-run around them in reaching out to small businesses.</p>
<p>Small businesses drive our national economies and are responsible for millions of websites worldwide. Of course, most small businesses don&#8217;t know (or even want to know) about the technical aspects of web standards, but they do want to know what will save them money and help them run their businesses more efficiently.</p>
<p>As the first project in our small business outreach effort, WaSP will be developing a resource to be used when interviewing individuals and teams to do web work. The focus of this effort will be a series of questions that, when asked of applicants, will help a small business determine whether or not they have the skills necessary to build a modern website. Each question be coupled with background on the associated topic that outlines why it is important and tips for determining how well the question was answered.</p>
<p>Our goals for this project are two-fold:</p>

<li>To support small businesses by protecting them from bad developers and making sure they get the best websites possible; and</li>
<li>To expose individual designers and small web shops to web standards when they go out to bid on projects in hopes that they will choose to upgrading their skills in order to continue getting work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to make this project a success, we need your help. Whether you are interested in helping us collect and organize the content or are keen to promote the resource once it&#8217;s complete, we want you to be involved. If you can lend a hand, please say so in a comment on this message and I will be in touch at the beginning of next week.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[We are proud to announce the WaSP InterAct Curriculum.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is with great pleasure that we unveil the <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">WaSP InterAct Curriculum</a>, an initiative that aims to unite industry, educators, and practitioners with one common goal: to improve the quality of education that the next generation of web professionals have available to them. Combining best practices in web design and development with best practices in education and human resources, we have assembled a group of passionate leaders that care deeply about education and that want to ensure that regardless of who you are, or where you&#8217;re learning about building the web &#8212; on your own, in an education institution or even on the job &#8212;  you learn best practices and have the skills that your employers want and need.</p>
<p>I was priveleged to see a glimpse of this in action at Web Directions North and saw the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2009/02/15/shared-passion/">Shared Passion</a> that was demonstrated by everyone there, and this initiative is nothing less than thrilling. We at WaSP hope that you&#8217;re as excited about this as we are.</p>
<p>Please join me in openly congratulating our team members of the WaSP Education Task Force that were so instrumental in planning and executing this unmatched resource: Aarron Walter, Steph Troeth, Leslie Jensen-Inman. There are many more contributors to this project, but without these three, this simply wouldn&#8217;t have happened. <strong>The three of you are inspirational to us all and give us a taste of what can be accomplished.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t end there, though. The web evolves. Web Standards evolve. And so will this resource. If you have a passion for education and making a difference, we&#8217;d love to have you involved.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something magical happens when you put a group of people that have a shared passion in the same room together. We&#8217;re not just talking &#8220;excitement&#8221; here, either. We&#8217;re talking passion &#8212; the kind that keeps the fire in the belly burning; the kind that brings people together from far away lands and unites them in a way that instantly seems like they&#8217;ve been friends forever.</p>
<p>This was the feeling in Denver at the education-focus day &#8220;<a href="http://north.webdirections.org/workshops#ed-directions-north-educating-the-next-generation-of-web-professionals">Ed Directions North</a>&#8221; (held in conjunction with <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">Web Directions North</a>). The day included teachers from high schools, from colleges and universities and from industry. The premise was simple: bring together educators, web professionals and industry representatives to create a kind of think tank on improving the quality of education for the next generation of web professionals.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;we&#8221; but really I mean to say that there were a few key people that were involved in putting this together:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/steph/">Steph Troeth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/awalter/">Aarron Walter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/cmills/">Chris Mills</a></li>
<li><a href="http://johnfallsopp.com/">John Allsopp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The tireless work of these people, especially Steph, Aarron and Chris with the hands-on work, and John for his support of the concept and the event combined with the work of <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/ljensen-inman/">Leslie Jensen-Inman</a> and <a href="http://www.webprofessionals.org/">Bill Cullifer</a> for their &#8220;<a href="http://north.webdirections.org/the-web-professional-education-summit">Web Professional Education Summit</a>&#8221; made for an excellent event with a focus on education like we haven&#8217;t seen before.</p>
<p>I was asked to share my expertise in accessibility (and teaching accessibility), others were there to share other specialties: <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://people.w3.org/mike/">Mike &#8482; Smith</a>, and <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a> (though I ended up delivering Christian&#8217;s slides on JavaScript as he got stuck in London with flight delays)</p>
<p>The bottom line? This was one of the most exciting events I&#8217;ve participated in. It was more than just a pre-conference. It was a group of people with a shared passion for education. It was enough to give me goosebumps, and others tell me they got an incredible buzz from it as well. This sounds incredibly corny to write, but on that day, we came away feeling like we really could make the world a better place. We had new friends, allies and conviction to improve the curriculum and teaching and learning materials for tomorrow&#8217;s web designers and developers.</p>
<p>This passion is what you&#8217;ll see when you come see the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/panels/?action=show&#038;id=IAP0900617">WaSP panel at SXSW</a> and learn of the work that we&#8217;re doing on the education front. This passion is what you&#8217;ll see as we create our direction forward as the Web Standards Project. This passion is what you&#8217;ll see as WaSP implements a vision of improving and continuing education about web standards and accessibility best practices. I hope you share the passion that we do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Texas is closing its <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/accessibility/">Accessibility Institute</a> today. Non-profit Knowbility has started a <a href="http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/SavetheInstitute">petition to save it</a>.</p>
<p>Though you may not have heard of the Accessibility Institute, you have been influenced by its work. Its late founder, Dr. John Slatin, was the former co-chair of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG2), and was an influential mentor to many of the web standards evangelists, including myself and current WaSP group manager, Glenda Sims. If you&#8217;ve ever attended <abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr>, you know Austin has one of the most vibrant web accessibility communities in the world, thanks to the hard work of Knowbility and the University of Texas Accessibility Institute. The knowledge shared by these groups has influenced web and software developers worldwide, resulting in a more accessible web used and enjoyed by all of us, disabled or not.</p>
<p>The importance of accessibility research and development was echoed this week by <a href="/2008/08/28/what-the-target-settlement-should-mean-to-you/">retailer Target&#8217;s decision to settle</a> its web accessibility discrimination lawsuit by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB). The story was covered in many US and international news outlets, and the the outcome of the case is a timely wake up call to the business world that <em>good design is accessible, universal design.</em> </p>
<p>The Accessibility Institute&#8217;s influence for the greater good cannot be overstated. The decision to close it on the eve of the universal design revolution is a poor choice by the UT Administration. If you agree, please sign the petition to keep accessibility research and development alive and well.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Since March 2008, the WaSP Education Task Force has begun working on the WaSP Curriculum Framework, a collection of tools aiming to identify skill sets and competencies that aspiring Web professionals need to acquire to prepare them for their chosen careers, as well as resources that will help both educators and students.
]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In parallel to the wonderful work that Chris Mills and team are doing on the <a href="http://www.opera.com/wsc/">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a>, the <a href="/action/edutf/">Education Task Force</a> has begun efforts since March this year on a complementary project: the WaSP Curriculum Framework. Our framework aims to identify the skill sets and competencies that aspiring Web professionals need to acquire to prepare them for their chosen careers.</p>
<p>In order to help educational institutions to identify and include material for these competencies, we are creating a set of foundation courses that can be readily adapted into an existing program at a college, school or university.</p>
<p>The framework will include a collection of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course overviews</li>
<li>Recommended course dependencies indicating what students will need to know before beginning each course</li>
<li>Learning competencies describing what students must master in order to receive a passing grade</li>
<li>Ideas for assignments and test questions that allow educators to measure a student’s mastery of each competency</li>
<li>Recommended textbooks and readings, including articles from the Opera Web Standards Curriculum and other reputable sources</li>
<li>A list of helpful resources, tools, and utilities specific to each course that will help both educators and students</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it called a framework? Given the velocity at which Web technology unravels, we recognize that required skill sets can change rapidly, and that the best way to keep this material useful is for the education community to enrich it with their expertise and experiences. In this way, the WaSP Curriculum Framework will be a &#8220;living curriculum&#8221; that we hope would be a knowledge base of required skills.</p>
<p>The framework will include guidelines to help educators around the world develop assignments and learning modules that address issues specific to their classrooms. These independently developed teaching materials can then be submitted back to the WaSP Curriculum Framework for review and potential inclusion in the project.</p>
<p>We are also actively working on connecting with other organizations and institutions to create as comprehensive a curriculum framework as possible.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to get involved by contributing content to the framework upon its initial release in March 2009. In the meantime, join the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18117748777">WaSP Edu Facebook group</a> to share your insights and participate in the discussion. Of course, there is always the <a href="http://lists.hesketh.com/mailman/listinfo/edutf-pp">WaSP EduTF public discussion list</a> if Facebook isn&#8217;t your thing.</p>
