			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You put on your blue beanie every year. But you can make a difference throughout the year.</p>
<p><img class="right" title="blue beanie" src="http://www.webstandards.org/wp/../files/stef-beanie.jpg" alt="blue beanie for web standards" width="150" />For several years, web workers passionate about web standards have donned <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/bbd/">blue beanies for one day</a> to bring attention to the importance of using web standards, keeping the web open, and continually moving it forward. We dutifully change our avatars on social media sites and the pictures on our web sites for a single unified day—this year on November 30. Of course this bewilders high school, college, and other non-tech friends on sites like Facebook, but we disregard their confusion in our eagerness to advocate the advancement of something we believe in. The following day, we return to our typical avatars and photos, all while making plans for a funnier, more creative blue beanie avatar for the next year.</p>
<h3>What if there is more?</h3>
<p>What if wearing that cute little blue toque was only the beginning of a continual journey?</p>
<ul>
<li>But I&#8217;m just a single developer&#8230;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t have an organization behind me&#8230;</li>
<li>The company I work for doesn&#8217;t really care&#8230;</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t really effect anything, why bother&#8230;</li>
<li>I already work 60 hours a week—I can&#8217;t fit anything else in&#8230;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t really have any original ideas&#8230;</li>
<li>Other developers know so much more than me&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the excuses that play in our heads when we contemplate doing more than putting on the beanie once a year. Today I&#8217;m happy to announce a new project, put together by a group of very passionate web folks, that can enable your entry into the process of moving the web forward—no matter what skill level you&#8217;re currently at—<a href="http://movethewebforward.org">Move the Web Forward</a>.</p>
<p>From the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to get started contributing to the platform, whether that&#8217;s learning more about how it works, teaching others, or writing specs. The web has grown due to people like you, and we want to make it even easier for people like you to give back.</p></blockquote>
<p>The web page is packed full of a generous range of ideas, from how to learn, and how to help other people learn, to how to hack the web and contribute to specs. There are few excuses left when the ideas are well organized allowing you to pick and choose what you, or your organization can handle. I&#8217;m impressed with the generosity of time and effort this group of devs have contributed to put this amazing resource together. Don&#8217;t miss it — <a href="http://movethewebforward.org">Move the Web Forward</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>You can make the web as awesome as you want it to be. Browser vendors, standards editors and library creators actively seek your voice and your contribution. Together we can move the web forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also check out Addy Osmani&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/30/the-smashing-guide-to-moving-the-web-forward-community/">article on Smashing Magazine</a> with more details on just how you can help move the web forward.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, many hands make light work. How fantastic would it be if there were so many hands that the burden didn&#8217;t fall on just a few? Together, let&#8217;s make the web rawk even harder!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Paciello Group and others are examining the accessibility of HTML5 implementations across the current spate of browsers. Their findings are a little disheartening.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=738">a recent blog post</a>, <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?author=1">Steve Faulkner</a> of the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com">Paciello Group</a> began to examine how HTML5, which is supposed to help improve the accessibility of web sites and applications, is being exposed to assistive technologies. The current state of things, as documented on <a href="http://HTML5Accessibility.com">HTML5Accessibility.com</a>, leaves a considerable amount to be desired.</p>
<blockquote cite="">
<p>The current accessibility support implemented in browsers lags behind their implementations of the sexy new features themselves. These are still early days in the implementation of HTML5 features, so lets keep our fingers crossed that Google,  Apple (Safari on Windows) and Opera will get their acts together to provide <em>at least</em> a basic level  of HTML support in their browsers for assistive technology users. Equally it is hoped  Mozilla, Apple (Safari on Mac) and Microsoft will strive to have their rate of accessibility support match their rapid implementation of the new HTML5 features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To address the need for standardizing the implementation of accessibility features, Steve and others have begun working on the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-api-map/overview.html">HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>We can’t thank Steve enough for his work on this and wish him well as these efforts continue.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With a little back-pedalling, the W3C has moved away from their blanket characterization of modern web tech as &#8220;HTML5&#8221;.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After receiving <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/">a wave</a> <a href="http://html5doctor.com/two-cheers-for-the-w3cs-html5-logo/">of negative</a> <a href="http://tantek.com/2011/020/b1/new-w3c-html5-logo">feedback</a> <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2011/01/18/regarding-the-html5-logo/">concerning the HTML5 logo</a>, the W3C have made steps towards righting things. If you read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html">HTML5 logo FAQ</a>, you&#8217;ll see that they&#8217;ve made some significant changes, including adding this:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html#css3">
<h3>Is W3C saying that CSS3 is part of the HTML5 specification?</h3>
<p>No. However, many HTML5 Web sites and applications do take advantage of CSS3 for styling and presentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good start, but there is still a lot to be done. The main <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">HTML5 logo page</a> still includes non-HTML5 (or event HTML5 web app-related) technologies such as CSS3, SVG, etc. And the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/#badge-builder">Badge Builder</a> still assembles a badge that makes these technologies appear subordinate to HTML5 as opposed to framing them as complementary, but distinct entities. We hope the FAQ change is not the end of their efforts to fix the potential confusion they have caused and that they will continue putting things right over coming days.</p>
<h2>On a related matter&#8230;</h2>
<p>As you probably heard, <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5">the WHATWG has decided to drop the &#8220;5&#8221; from their work on the HTML language</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5"><p>&#8230;we realised that the demand for new features in HTML remained high, and so we would have to continue maintaining HTML and adding features to it before we could call &#8220;HTML5&#8243; complete, and as a result we moved to a new development model, where the technology is not versioned and instead we just have a living document that defines the technology as it evolves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first blush, many of us were a little distraught by this decision because we thought the W3C might decide to follow suit, but after thinking on it a bit, the decision makes sense: the WHATWG can work on the HTML markup language in a fluid way and the W3C can take snapshots of that work and christen it with a version number for reference purposes.</p>
<p>Some might argue that version numbers are meaningless on the ever-evolving web, but they do help us establish mile-markers or guideposts which aid in both education and accountability. Sure, both versions 4 and 5 of HTML are still HTML, but, as the saying goes, you can&#8217;t build on shifting sands. It&#8217;s frustrating to teach from an ever-changing spec. The same goes for authoring to one. Some manner of stability is necessary so you know what is &#8220;true&#8221; <em>now</em> (or at least at some point in time), even if those circumstances may change in six months or six years. Not having a version number will make it really hard to educate people about the <strong>current</strong> set of new HTML features, and how they differ from the old version (which rather contradicts the purpose of the HTML5 logo in the first place).</p>
<p>Not that there was really a question, but we stand by our sentiment that the final (as in W3C) version of HTML5 should continue having a version number while the version-less WHATWG version is used for continuing development.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In which we ask that the W3C to come up with a new monicker for the umbrella of modern web technologies.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today brings to us the news that the W3C have unveiled <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">a logo for HTML5</a>. Does an open technology <em>need</em> a logo? Perhaps not, but many see it as a good idea, including myself. I think it is a great idea to create a rallying flag/focus point for people to  use to show their support of HTML5, and to help increase awareness and propagation of this important new technology, thereby aiding the evolution of the open web.</p>
<p>But wait, things are not quite right. If you delve deeper you&#8217;ll see that, included in their definition of <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/#the-technology">the technology that comprises HTML5</a>, is CSS3, <abbr title="Web Open Font Format">WOFF</abbr>, SVG, and a few other cuckoos in the HTML5 nest. If you look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html">HTML5 Logo FAQ</a>, you&#8217;ll find the following:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html"><p>The logo is a general-purpose visual identity for a broad set of open web technologies, including HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t good—I appreciate that it is good to have an umbrella term for a group of related technologies and techniques that would otherwise be difficult to talk about in conversation. &#8220;Ajax&#8221; and &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; serve that purpose well. And it is ok to talk about closely-related specs such as <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html">Geolocation</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">Web Sockets</a> as being under the HTML5 umbrella, as long as you clarify it somewhere (you can find a good example in <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/get-familiar-with-html5/">Get familiar with HTML5!</a>). But this is different—HTML5 and CSS3, for example, are two distinctly different technologies, and should not be confused with one another. To do so will impede learning and cause problems with development, documentation, and all manner of other things.</p>
<p>You could perhaps forgive marketers for getting it confused, but then again their confusion is not so critical as long as their end product looks and works great, and they have a web developer behind them to put them right at critical points. But I have talked to many <strong>web developers</strong> that are confused, and honestly think that CSS3 and SVG are part of HTML5.</p>
<p>There has understandably been some bad feeling about this in the web community. Jeremy Keith put it nicely in <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><q>Badge of Shame</q></a>, and Bruce Lawson also gave a good view in <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/on-the-html5-logo/">On the HTML5 logo</a>, as well as providing a good rant to put things straight: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEncpCDEBI">HTML5 != CSS3</a>. At Opera, my colleagues and I are constantly reiterating a more accurate definition of HTML5 to help overcome such confusion, and many allies at other browser vendors are doing the same.</p>
<p>But standing against the W3C is not the way to solve this either. In light of this, we at the WaSP are sending an open letter to folks at the W3C, urging them to fix this oversight. The letter is thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear W3C,</p>
<p>We are writing to address a major concern we at WaSP (and in the web professional community in general) have with the newly-unveiled HTML5 brand. While we are excited that the W3C is doing so much to promote new technologies being developed, we are incredibly concerned that using &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as the umbrella for these technologies does more harm than good.</p>
<p>&#8220;HTML5,&#8221; as a term, has become a bit of a beast and is already presenting problems:</p>
<p>First, you’ve got HTML5 &#8220;the spec&#8221; which isn&#8217;t just HTML markup anymore, but includes specifications for everything from local databases to web workers. Explaining what we mean when we talk about &#8220;HTML5&#8221; requires use of modifying phrases, as in &#8220;HTML5 the markup language&#8221; or &#8220;HTML5 geolocation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then Apple and Google began promoting the use of &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as as a catch-all term for marketing their browser advancements, much as Microsoft and Netscape (and journalists) had used &#8220;DHTML&#8221; in the past. The term became less meaningful because it was being used to cover more ground and, consequently, it made communications between developers and clients more difficult because both sides did not have the same understanding of what HTML5 meant.</p>
<p>Now the W3C has come out and essentially condoned the branding of everything from CSS to actual HTML5 to WOFF as &#8220;HTML5&#8221;. We can&#8217;t imagine a single action that will cause more confusion than this misguided decision (and the W3C has produced some pretty impenetrable specs in its time). Our own Jeremy Keith summed it up perfectly when he said</p>
<blockquote cite="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><p>What we have here is a deliberate attempt to further blur the lines between separate technologies that have already become intertwingled in media reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need for the W3C, as a standards body, to understand the importance of clarity with regard to the term &#8220;HTML5&#8221;. Without being able to draw clear distinctions between technologies, clear communication about those technologies becomes increasingly difficult if not impossible. As an organization of web professionals promoting the inclusion of web standards in the education of future web professionals and the adoption of web standards among practicing professionals, we are deeply concerned that your decision will make our job even harder.</p>
<p>So, when push comes to shove, what do we want you to change? Well, we think a good place to start is backing away from the use of &#8220;HTML5&#8221; as a catch-all term. If you feel you need a catch-all term, come up with something else, but as Jeremy also said</p>
<blockquote cite="http://adactio.com/journal/4289/"><p>We [developers] never needed a term to refer to &#8220;XHTML 1.0 plus CSS2.1&#8221; or &#8220;HTML4.01 plus JavaScript&#8221; or &#8220;any combination of front-end technologies.&#8221; Why this sudden all-conquering need for a term that covers so many different technologies as to be completely meaningless?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a new moniker for the umbrella of modern web technologies, the blurred distinction between the diverse languages and systems that comprise it will evaporate and we won&#8217;t have to worry (as much) about the potential for miscommunication. Hey, it will even give you a chance to create another logo.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>The Web Standards Project</p>
</blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[The IE9 "developer previews" continue to impress. HTML5, CSS3, &#038; speed improvements <abbr title="for the win">FTW</abbr>!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the IE team announced their work on IE9 earlier this year, they promised three major improvements:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>speed</li>
</ol>
<p>Now three &#8220;developer previews&#8221; in, by all accounts they’re living up to that promise: HTML5 support is increasing rapidly (including support for <code>canvas</code>; <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/ies_big_leap_fo.html">as PPK just confirmed</a>, their CSS3 support is nearly complete; and several benchmark tests put them right up there with Chrome in terms of speed.</p>
<p>In playing around with the browser, I&#8217;ve been really impressed so far. To me, IE9 really puts the oft-maligned browser on par with the remainder of the browser landscape and even gives them the edge in certain cases. My hat’s off to the IE team, this is great work. I’m excited to see what happens as it continues to develop.</p>
<p>You can download the IE9 preview and check out some of the demos at <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/</a>, but keep in mind that you’ll need Vista or Windows 7 to run it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s coming in 2012. Or maybe 2022. It&#8217;s certainly <a href="http://ishtml5readyyet.com/">not ready yet</a>, but some parts are already in browsers <strong>now</strong> so for the standards-savvy  developers, the future is worth investigating today. <a href="/about/members/hixie/">Ian &#8220;Hixie&#8221; Hickson</a>, editor of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 specification, hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft  in October <strong>this year</strong>.</p>
<p>Accessibility Task Force member, <a href="/about/members/blawson/">Bruce Lawson</a>, interviews Hixie on how the specification for the next generation of the Web&#8217;s markup language is shaping up. Disclosure of affiliations: both work for browser vendors&mdash;Bruce  for Opera, Hixie  for Google (and previously, Opera and Netscape).</p>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spec now known as <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 began with a &quot;guerilla&quot; group called <abbr>WHATWG</abbr>. How and why did the <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> begin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer is the <abbr>W3C</abbr> told us to. </p>
<p> The long answer: Back in 2003, when XForms was going through its final<br />
        stages (the &quot;Proposed Recommendation&quot; vote stage), the browser vendors<br />
        were concerned that it wouldn&#8217;t take off on the Web without being made a<br />
        part of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and out of that big discussion (which unfortunately is<br />
        mostly hidden behind the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s confidentiality walls) came a proof of<br />
        concept showing that it was possible to take some of XForms&#8217; ideas and put<br />
        then into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4. We originally called it &quot;XForms Basic&quot;, and later renamed<br />
        it &quot;WebForms 2.0&quot;. This formed the basis of what is now <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.</p>
<p> In 2004, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had a workshop, the &quot;The <abbr>W3C</abbr> Workshop on Web Applications<br />
        and Compound Documents&quot;, where we (the browser vendors) argued that it was<br />
        imperative that <abbr>HTML</abbr> be extended in a backwards-compatible way. It was a<br />
        turning point in the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s history&mdash;you could tell because at one point<br />
        RedHat, Sun, and Microsoft, arch-rivals all, actually agreed on something,<br />
        and that <b>never</b> happens.</p>
<p> The outcome of that workshop was that the <abbr>W3C</abbr> concluded that <abbr>HTML</abbr> was<br />
        still dead, as had been decided in a workshop in 1998, and that if we<br />
        wanted to do something like <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, we should go elsewhere. So we announced<br />
        a mailing list, and did it there.</p>

        Opera and Mozilla acting together (with Apple cheering us from the<br />
        sidelines).</p>

<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has varied over the years, as we&#8217;ve gone from a nascent organisation<br />
        with a few dozen people to a well-established project with a mailing list<br />
        with 900+ subscribers. Mostly it&#8217;s all down to managing e-mail. When<br />
        someone writes feedback on the spec, whether by sending an e-mail to one<br />
        of the mailing lists I&#8217;m on, or by blogging somewhere, or twittering, I<br />
        log their feedback in a folder on my IMAP server. Feedback gets<br />
        categorised into either feedback I can work on right away, or feedback<br />
        that I can&#8217;t deal with yet for whatever reason. An example of the latter<br />
        would be requests relating to mutation events, because I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
        DOM3 Events to update how mutation events work. </p>
<p> Then, I just go through all the feedback I have, e-mail by e-mail, more or<br />
        less in the order that I received them, sending replies and fixing the<br />
        spec to address the issues that were raised.</p>
<p> This has some disadvantages, for example there&#8217;s a big delay in between<br />
        when someone spots an error and when I fix it. It also has some really<br />
        important advantages. If I respond to feedback on something I wrote<br />
        straight after writing it, I sometimes find that I have an attachment to<br />
        that section, so if someone suggests a total replacement, I tend to not<br />
        like their idea. But if I have a delay, I find my attachment has gone<br />
        away, and I&#8217;m eager to replace my old stupid idea with their better one.<br />
        (Assuming it&#8217;s better, anyway!) </p>

<p>What&#8217;s the hardest thing to do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few things that are hard. One is saying &quot;no&quot; to people who have<br />
        clearly spent the time to come up with a good idea. The sad truth is that<br />
        I reject almost everything that I and anyone else thinks of, because if I<br />
        didn&#8217;t, the spec would be a thousand times more bloated than it is now. We<br />
        get proposals for all kinds of things, and we have to have a very high bar<br />
        for what goes in. There&#8217;s also the danger that if we add too many things<br />
        to the spec too quickly, the browser vendors will each implement their own<br />
        bit and it&#8217;ll be a big mess that won&#8217;t help Web authors. </p>
<p> So I have to make judgements about what is worth adding and what isn&#8217;t,<br />
        and that&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ve upset a lot of people by rejecting their ideas,<br />
        because they take it personally. On the other hand, some of the most<br />
        productive members of the community now are people who&#8217;ve had many of<br />
        their ideas rejected, but they stuck around long enough to see a few of<br />
        their ideas make it in. The best way to get an idea into the spec is to<br />
        find something in the spec that&#8217;s just clearly wrong, which is something<br />
        that a lot of the most active people do a lot, too!</p>
<p> Something else that&#8217;s hard is making up new features. The bulk of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is<br />
        actually just defining how browsers already do things, which, although<br />
        complicated and sometimes unbelievably arcane, is, at the end of the day,<br />
        pretty easy to spec: you test the browsers, and you write what they do.<br />
        Rinse, repeat, until the spec covers every possible case.</p>
<p> Making up new features, though, means actually thinking about what should<br />
        happen, what is the most understandable solution, figuring out how things<br />
        should fit together, and so on. It&#8217;s often tempting to make something that<br />
        is theoretically neat, but which doesn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the<br />
        language, too. After all, that&#8217;s where all this came from&mdash;we don&#8217;t want<br />
        to create a new XForms, a really well-designed technology that doesn&#8217;t fit<br />
        into the way people write pages. </p>

<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started from trying to put features from XForms into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, and we<br />
        quickly also took the opportunity to fix some of the things in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 that<br />
        were either too vague or disagreed with reality (that is, where the<br />
        browsers all did one thing but the spec said another). It turns out that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is so vague that this is a pretty big task&mdash;it even involved<br />
        defining the whole <abbr>HTML</abbr> parsing model, including error handling, which is<br />
        a huge job (it took me the better part of a month to write the first<br />
        draft, and we were tweaking it for about a year before it become more or<br />
        less stable).</p>
<p>Something else we&#8217;ve tried to do is make things simpler. We&#8217;ve simplified<br />
        the syntax (e.g. the rules about what can be quoted, what strings are<br />
        valid <code>id</code>s, etc, are much simpler now). We&#8217;ve made things which people<br />
        used to do in JavaScript have shortcuts, so now you can just say <code>autofocus=&quot;&quot;</code> to focus a form field when the page loads, instead of using <code>control.focus()</code>, which allows the browser to do clever things like not<br />
        actually focus the control if the user is already typing elsewhere.</p>

<p> Does including JavaScript and DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 spec dilute the<br />
        message about separating behaviour and structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know about a message about separating behaviour and structure, I<br />
        must have missed that memo! <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 takes a pretty hard line on separating<br />
        style and presentation from structure and semantics; there are no more <code>font</code> tags. Separating the logic and behaviour from the structure and<br />
        semantics of an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document isn&#8217;t as important, generally, as far as I<br />
        can tell. </p>
<p> The main advantage of defining the <abbr>HTML</abbr> DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements in<br />
        the same specification is that we don&#8217;t let stuff fall through the cracks.<br />
        In practice, browsers implement the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements as DOM nodes, there&#8217;s no<br />
        difference. When we separate the two in the specs, therefore, we introduce<br />
        a conceptual gap where there isn&#8217;t one in reality. The DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> spec, for<br />
        instance, doesn&#8217;t say what happens when you change the <code>type</code> attribute of<br />
        an <code>input</code> element <code>from</code> text  to <code>checkbox</code> on the fly, and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4<br />
        spec doesn&#8217;t mention that changing attributes on the fly is possible, so<br />
        in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 / DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> era, there&#8217;s a big hole there. In <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, this is<br />
        all defined together, so we can tighten this up and make sure there are no<br />
        gaps.</p>

<p>Microformats is natively supported in HTML5, just like it was in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,<br />

        it, I don&#8217;t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of<br />
        authoring. For example, it uses namespaces and prefixes, which by and<br />
        large confuse authors to no end. Just recently though I proposed something<br />
        of a compromise which takes some of <abbr>RDFa</abbr>&#8216;s better ideas and puts them into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused<br />

        that they Just Work for everyone, regardless of how you are accessing the<br />
        Web. For example, in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 we&#8217;ve added new input controls like calendars.<br />

<p>Today is probably too early to start using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. </p>
<p> Long term, content authors will find a variety of new features in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.<br />
        We have a bunch of new structural elements like <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>footer</code>, and so on. We have new elements for embedded media, like <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>. We have new input controls, like the calendars I mentioned,<br />
        but also fields for <abbr>URL</abbr>s, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and for<br />
        color selection. We have control over autocomplete values in text fields,<br />
        as well as field validation so that you can say which fields are required.<br />
        We have context menus, <code>pushState()</code> so you can update the <abbr>URL</abbr> in Ajax<br />
        applications, and offline application cache manifests so that your users<br />
        can take your applications offline. The list goes on.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s also the benefits that come from using an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 validator. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5<br />
        is much more precise about many things than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, so the validators will<br />

        tested), so we have to start from scratch with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. The <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 team will<br />
        at least be able to build on what we&#8217;ve done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, I&#8217;m jealous!</p>
<p> Actually if it was up to me, after <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 I would probably transition <abbr>HTML</abbr> to an incremental model. Once we have a basic spec that is well-defined<br />
        and has been proven, instead of releasing a frozen snapshot every few<br />
        years, I&#8217;d prefer a model where we can slowly evolve the language, call it<br />
        &quot;<abbr>HTML</abbr> Current&quot; or something, without having to worry about versioning it.<br />
        To some extent that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but I think formalising<br />
        it would really help.</p>
<p> Having versions of specs doesn&#8217;t make sense when you have multiple<br />
        implementations that are all evolving as well. No browser is ever going to<br />
        be exactly <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, they&#8217;ll all be subsets or supersets. So why bother with<br />
        versioning the spec?</p>
<p> It&#8217;s a very unusual idea in the standards world, so I don&#8217;t expect us to<br />
        do this. But I do think it&#8217;d be the best way forward.</p>

<p>Too early to tell! It&#8217;s been a lot of fun working on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, it&#8217;s quite<br />
        challenging and you have to deal with all kinds of issues from the deeply<br />
        technical to the highly political. I might want a change of pace when<br />
        we&#8217;re done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, though.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s your fave feature that didn&#8217;t get into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 that you&#8217;d put<br />

<p>In-window modal dialogs or dialog box&mdash;the kind of prompt you get when the<br />
        computer asks you a question and won&#8217;t let you do anything else until you<br />
        answer the question. For instance, the window that comes up when you say<br />
        &quot;Save As&#8230;&quot; is usually a modal dialog.</p>
<p>Right now people fake it with <code>div</code>s and<br />
        complicated styles and script. It would be neat to just be able to say<br />
        &quot;make this section a modal dialog&quot;. Like <code>showModalDialog()</code>, but within<br />
        the page instead of opening a new window with a new page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d add it to <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but there are so many new features already that we<br />
        need to wait for the browsers to catch up.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The editor of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 spec, Ian Hickson, <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/help-us-review-html5">calls for input on issues in the spec</a>&mdash;typos, contradictions, or simply confusing bits. If everything goes according to plan, all issues will get a response from the editor before October.</p>
<p>He says</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.whatwg.org/help-us-review-html5">
<p>The plan is to see whether we can shake down the spec and get rid of all the minor problems that have so far been overlooked. Typos, confusion, cross-reference errors, as well as mistakes in examples, errors in the definitions, and major errors like security bugs or contradictions.</p>
<p>Anyone who helps find problems in the spec — however minor — will get their name in the acknowledgements section. </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t really need any experience to find the simplest class of problems: things that are confusing! If you don&#8217;t understand something, then that&#8217;s a problem. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s lots to dislike in the spec: my bugbears are the hamstrung <code>time</code> element, the continued use of <code>dd</code> and <code>dt</code> for dialogues. But it&#8217;s almost certainly the future of web markup, so this is your chance to <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/help-us-review-html5">influence that future</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fancy giving your site a hardcore usability test? Then why not involve people with disabilities in your testing. Not sure where to start? Then check out <strong>Just Ask: integrating accessibility throughout design</strong>.</p>
<p>This free online book, written by Shawn Lawton Henry from <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> in her spare time, looks at all you need to know about user testing with people with disabilities. In it she covers theory rather than code focusing on accessibility in the user-centered design process, how to recruit people with disabilities, user groups and persona&#8217;s, evaluation and much more.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not a book about accessibility techniques, be that HTML, CSS or scripting advice. And despite working for the W3C, Shawn has not created another W3C-style document. This book will find most use, I think, with people who already do testing of some nature but to whom accessibility is still a black art. It will also appeal to people running small business &#8211; perhaps developers who know their HTML/CSS trade inside and out but want to be able to expand their horizons and go beyond simply saying &#8220;we create accessible web sites&#8221; and really mean it &#8211; and I would also recommend that some of the accessibility gurus take a leaf through this and not assume that they know it already.</p></blockquote>

<p>What&#8217;s really good about Just Ask is that not only is it a free online book it&#8217;s also available in Japanese and Spanish. Alternatively, for a small donation, you can get a hard copy of the English version.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I'm so tired of people half-assing it on Casual Day, but <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">Naked Day</a>? Now you have my full attention]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a> will be held on Wednesday, April 9. This annual event is intended to promote the <acronym title="Plain Old Semantic HTML">POSH</acronym> portion of the Web Standards trinity by having designers and developers remove all CSS from a Web site &#8212; thereby stripping it of its design and thus underscoring the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_style_and_content">separation of presentation and content</a>.</p>
<p>To get involved, just delete or comment any references to CSS on your Web site during  Wednesday. </p>
<p>Exhibitionists can even advertise their page&#8217;s nakedness on the <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/#signup">official event site</a>. Also included on the site is a PHP function to automatically remove CSS references from your site for the big day.</p>
<h3>Why won&#8217;t WaSP get naked?</h3>
<p>The Web Standards Project Web site gets a lot of traffic each day from curious folks who are new to Web Standards and may not yet understand concepts like POSH and progressive enhancement. We want them to see a styled site on each and every visit so they can witness these practices in action. And as one might suspect, it&#8217;s hard to teach with your drawers showing, much less off your &lt;body&gt;.</p>
<p>That said, many popular Web developer tools (including the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&#038;displaylang=en">Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar</a> and the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer Toolbar</a> for Firefox/Flock and Seamonkey) give a user the ability to easily disable CSS, thus rendering the same unstyled experience whenever you want and not just on one day. </p>
<p>So, please give these tools a try to see how WaSP structures its sting and be sure to enjoy <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a> this Wednesday.</p>
