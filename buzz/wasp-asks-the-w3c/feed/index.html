			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a conversation with <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Brewer/">Judy Brewer</a> from the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> back in February, <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/jsmith/">Jared Smith</a> had the chance to interview her and submit some probing questions about what&#8217;s happening with <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0. Thanks Judy&#8230;and nice one Jared! See the <a href="/learn/articles/askw3c/may2007/">interview with Judy Brewer on <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0</a> in our <a href="/learn/articles/askw3c/"><abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr> Asks the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a> section.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Judy clarified that, although she did check with the co-chairs of the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> Working Group and some other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> staff, the answers are primarily her take on things&#8230;so I&#8217;ve amended the entry accordingly.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, we <a href="/learn/askw3c/jun2004.html">asked the W3C</a>: how do we go about including multimedia objects in Web documents in a backwards-compatible way? In the <a href="/learn/askw3c/jun2004.html">first</a> of a two-part issue, the W3C gave us a little history lesson about the birth of multimedia inclusion in HTML documents. </p>
<p>Now, in this long-awaited <a href="/learn/askw3c/may2005.html">second part</a>, we explore why the notion of backwards-compatibility doesn&#8217;t gel with the concept of multimedia inclusion.  We present examples of how the <code>object</code> element works, as well as a <a href="/learn/askw3c/object-tests.html">framework</a> that we can all use to collectively test the level of support of this element in user agents.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="/learn/askw3c/">WaSP asks the W3C</a> project, we consult the W3C about the correct way to include multimedia elements such as sound, animation and video into our humble (X)HTML pages. In <a href="http://webstandards.org/learn/askw3c/jun2004.html">the first</a> of a two-part article, the W3C provides some context for this issue and fills us in on the <a href="http://webstandards.org/learn/askw3c/jun2004.html">history of the birth of multimedia in HTML</a>.</p>

<p>So which one <em>is</em> better: <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/askw3c/oct2003.html">HTML or XHTML</a>?  Seems simple in the midst of this flurry of acronyms such as XAML and XUL. The W3C wants to help you stop the wind from whirling for just a moment and answer that simple but smart question as to which markup language for the web you should be using today.</p>
