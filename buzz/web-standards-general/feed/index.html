			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=738">a recent blog post</a>, <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?author=1">Steve Faulkner</a> of the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com">Paciello Group</a> began to examine how HTML5, which is supposed to help improve the accessibility of web sites and applications, is being exposed to assistive technologies. The current state of things, as documented on <a href="http://HTML5Accessibility.com">HTML5Accessibility.com</a>, leaves a considerable amount to be desired.</p>
<blockquote cite="">
<p>The current accessibility support implemented in browsers lags behind their implementations of the sexy new features themselves. These are still early days in the implementation of HTML5 features, so lets keep our fingers crossed that Google,  Apple (Safari on Windows) and Opera will get their acts together to provide <em>at least</em> a basic level  of HTML support in their browsers for assistive technology users. Equally it is hoped  Mozilla, Apple (Safari on Mac) and Microsoft will strive to have their rate of accessibility support match their rapid implementation of the new HTML5 features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To address the need for standardizing the implementation of accessibility features, Steve and others have begun working on the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-api-map/overview.html">HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>We can’t thank Steve enough for his work on this and wish him well as these efforts continue.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s coming in 2012. Or maybe 2022. It&#8217;s certainly <a href="http://ishtml5readyyet.com/">not ready yet</a>, but some parts are already in browsers <strong>now</strong> so for the standards-savvy  developers, the future is worth investigating today. <a href="/about/members/hixie/">Ian &#8220;Hixie&#8221; Hickson</a>, editor of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 specification, hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft  in October <strong>this year</strong>.</p>
<p>Accessibility Task Force member, <a href="/about/members/blawson/">Bruce Lawson</a>, interviews Hixie on how the specification for the next generation of the Web&#8217;s markup language is shaping up. Disclosure of affiliations: both work for browser vendors&mdash;Bruce  for Opera, Hixie  for Google (and previously, Opera and Netscape).</p>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spec now known as <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 began with a &quot;guerilla&quot; group called <abbr>WHATWG</abbr>. How and why did the <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> begin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer is the <abbr>W3C</abbr> told us to. </p>
<p> The long answer: Back in 2003, when XForms was going through its final<br />
        stages (the &quot;Proposed Recommendation&quot; vote stage), the browser vendors<br />
        were concerned that it wouldn&#8217;t take off on the Web without being made a<br />
        part of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and out of that big discussion (which unfortunately is<br />
        mostly hidden behind the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s confidentiality walls) came a proof of<br />
        concept showing that it was possible to take some of XForms&#8217; ideas and put<br />
        then into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4. We originally called it &quot;XForms Basic&quot;, and later renamed<br />
        it &quot;WebForms 2.0&quot;. This formed the basis of what is now <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.</p>
<p> In 2004, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had a workshop, the &quot;The <abbr>W3C</abbr> Workshop on Web Applications<br />
        and Compound Documents&quot;, where we (the browser vendors) argued that it was<br />
        imperative that <abbr>HTML</abbr> be extended in a backwards-compatible way. It was a<br />
        turning point in the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s history&mdash;you could tell because at one point<br />
        RedHat, Sun, and Microsoft, arch-rivals all, actually agreed on something,<br />
        and that <b>never</b> happens.</p>
<p> The outcome of that workshop was that the <abbr>W3C</abbr> concluded that <abbr>HTML</abbr> was<br />
        still dead, as had been decided in a workshop in 1998, and that if we<br />
        wanted to do something like <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, we should go elsewhere. So we announced<br />
        a mailing list, and did it there.</p>
<p>At the time I was working for Opera Software, but &quot;we&quot; in this case was<br />
        Opera and Mozilla acting together (with Apple cheering us from the<br />
        sidelines).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did you become editor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p> I was at the right place at the right time and everyone else was too busy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you personally go about editing the spec and  incorporating<br />
        feedback? What are your processes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has varied over the years, as we&#8217;ve gone from a nascent organisation<br />
        with a few dozen people to a well-established project with a mailing list<br />
        with 900+ subscribers. Mostly it&#8217;s all down to managing e-mail. When<br />
        someone writes feedback on the spec, whether by sending an e-mail to one<br />
        of the mailing lists I&#8217;m on, or by blogging somewhere, or twittering, I<br />
        log their feedback in a folder on my IMAP server. Feedback gets<br />
        categorised into either feedback I can work on right away, or feedback<br />
        that I can&#8217;t deal with yet for whatever reason. An example of the latter<br />
        would be requests relating to mutation events, because I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
        DOM3 Events to update how mutation events work. </p>
<p> Then, I just go through all the feedback I have, e-mail by e-mail, more or<br />
        less in the order that I received them, sending replies and fixing the<br />
        spec to address the issues that were raised.</p>
<p> This has some disadvantages, for example there&#8217;s a big delay in between<br />
        when someone spots an error and when I fix it. It also has some really<br />
        important advantages. If I respond to feedback on something I wrote<br />
        straight after writing it, I sometimes find that I have an attachment to<br />
        that section, so if someone suggests a total replacement, I tend to not<br />
        like their idea. But if I have a delay, I find my attachment has gone<br />
        away, and I&#8217;m eager to replace my old stupid idea with their better one.<br />
        (Assuming it&#8217;s better, anyway!) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the hardest thing to do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few things that are hard. One is saying &quot;no&quot; to people who have<br />
        clearly spent the time to come up with a good idea. The sad truth is that<br />
        I reject almost everything that I and anyone else thinks of, because if I<br />
        didn&#8217;t, the spec would be a thousand times more bloated than it is now. We<br />
        get proposals for all kinds of things, and we have to have a very high bar<br />
        for what goes in. There&#8217;s also the danger that if we add too many things<br />
        to the spec too quickly, the browser vendors will each implement their own<br />
        bit and it&#8217;ll be a big mess that won&#8217;t help Web authors. </p>
<p> So I have to make judgements about what is worth adding and what isn&#8217;t,<br />
        and that&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ve upset a lot of people by rejecting their ideas,<br />
        because they take it personally. On the other hand, some of the most<br />
        productive members of the community now are people who&#8217;ve had many of<br />
        their ideas rejected, but they stuck around long enough to see a few of<br />
        their ideas make it in. The best way to get an idea into the spec is to<br />
        find something in the spec that&#8217;s just clearly wrong, which is something<br />
        that a lot of the most active people do a lot, too!</p>
<p> Something else that&#8217;s hard is making up new features. The bulk of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is<br />
        actually just defining how browsers already do things, which, although<br />
        complicated and sometimes unbelievably arcane, is, at the end of the day,<br />
        pretty easy to spec: you test the browsers, and you write what they do.<br />
        Rinse, repeat, until the spec covers every possible case.</p>
<p> Making up new features, though, means actually thinking about what should<br />
        happen, what is the most understandable solution, figuring out how things<br />
        should fit together, and so on. It&#8217;s often tempting to make something that<br />
        is theoretically neat, but which doesn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the<br />
        language, too. After all, that&#8217;s where all this came from&mdash;we don&#8217;t want<br />
        to create a new XForms, a really well-designed technology that doesn&#8217;t fit<br />
        into the way people write pages. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What&#8217;s in the spec?</h3>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve said that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0215.html"><abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is in &quot;direct competition with other  technologies intended for applications deployed over the Web, in  particular Flash and Silverlight</a>&quot;. Why  is it so important to do so, and isn&#8217;t it a lost cause given that those  techologies are already out there while <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is not yet complete?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML 4 is also in direct competition with proprietary technologies, and<br />
        it&#8217;s winning, hands-down. HTML5 is just continuing the battle, because if<br />
        we don&#8217;t keep up, then the proprietary technologies will gain ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the main philosophies of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Backwards-compatibility, incremental baby steps, defining error handling.<br />
        Those are the main philosophies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What else did <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> try to achieve with this new iteration of <abbr>HTML</abbr>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started from trying to put features from XForms into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, and we<br />
        quickly also took the opportunity to fix some of the things in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 that<br />
        were either too vague or disagreed with reality (that is, where the<br />
        browsers all did one thing but the spec said another). It turns out that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is so vague that this is a pretty big task&mdash;it even involved<br />
        defining the whole <abbr>HTML</abbr> parsing model, including error handling, which is<br />
        a huge job (it took me the better part of a month to write the first<br />
        draft, and we were tweaking it for about a year before it become more or<br />
        less stable).</p>
<p>Something else we&#8217;ve tried to do is make things simpler. We&#8217;ve simplified<br />
        the syntax (e.g. the rules about what can be quoted, what strings are<br />
        valid <code>id</code>s, etc, are much simpler now). We&#8217;ve made things which people<br />
        used to do in JavaScript have shortcuts, so now you can just say <code>autofocus=&quot;&quot;</code> to focus a form field when the page loads, instead of using <code>control.focus()</code>, which allows the browser to do clever things like not<br />
        actually focus the control if the user is already typing elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 legitimise tag soup? Does &quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#pave-the-cowpaths">paving the cowpaths</a>&quot; perpetuate<br />
        bad markup?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie:</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 actually makes the rules for markup even stricter than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 in<br />
        many ways, both for authors (the rules are simpler, but stricter, than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4&#8242;s) and for implementers (gone are the days where they can just do<br />
        whatever they want when handling parse errors, now every browser has to<br />
        act the same). </p>
<p> Hopefully, we&#8217;ve managed to make the rules on what is valid syntax more<br />
        understandable, which should help with getting more good markup. We&#8217;ve<br />
        also made it possible to write clearer validators, so I have high hopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p> Does including JavaScript and DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 spec dilute the<br />
        message about separating behaviour and structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know about a message about separating behaviour and structure, I<br />
        must have missed that memo! <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 takes a pretty hard line on separating<br />
        style and presentation from structure and semantics; there are no more <code>font</code> tags. Separating the logic and behaviour from the structure and<br />
        semantics of an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document isn&#8217;t as important, generally, as far as I<br />
        can tell. </p>
<p> The main advantage of defining the <abbr>HTML</abbr> DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements in<br />
        the same specification is that we don&#8217;t let stuff fall through the cracks.<br />
        In practice, browsers implement the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements as DOM nodes, there&#8217;s no<br />
        difference. When we separate the two in the specs, therefore, we introduce<br />
        a conceptual gap where there isn&#8217;t one in reality. The DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> spec, for<br />
        instance, doesn&#8217;t say what happens when you change the <code>type</code> attribute of<br />
        an <code>input</code> element <code>from</code> text  to <code>checkbox</code> on the fly, and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4<br />
        spec doesn&#8217;t mention that changing attributes on the fly is possible, so<br />
        in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 / DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> era, there&#8217;s a big hole there. In <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, this is<br />
        all defined together, so we can tighten this up and make sure there are no<br />
        gaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why no native support for microformats/ <abbr>RDFa</abbr> in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microformats is natively supported in HTML5, just like it was in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,<br />
        because Microformats use the built-in extension mechanisms of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.</p>
<p>We considered RDFa long and hard (in fact this is an issue that&#8217;s a hot<br />
        topic right now), but at the end of the day, while some people really like<br />
        it, I don&#8217;t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of<br />
        authoring. For example, it uses namespaces and prefixes, which by and<br />
        large confuse authors to no end. Just recently though I proposed something<br />
        of a compromise which takes some of <abbr>RDFa</abbr>&#8216;s better ideas and puts them into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused<br />
        people to invent <abbr>RDFa</abbr>. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<h3>About browsers</h3>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the browser makers have too much influence on the spec?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the browser vendors have the ultimate veto on<br />
        everything in the spec, since if they don&#8217;t implement it, the spec is<br />
        nothing but a work of fiction. So they have a lot of influence&mdash;I don&#8217;t<br />
        want to be writing fiction, I want to be writing a spec that documents the<br />
        actual behaviour of browsers. </p>
<p> Whether that&#8217;s too much, I don&#8217;t know. Does gravity have too much<br />
        influence on objects on earth? It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the chairs of the <abbr>W3C</abbr> working group is a Microsoft employee. Is that giving too much power to one browser vendor,  or a good thing,<br />
        given that Microsoft&#8217;s browsers still dominate and their buy-in on any spec is<br />
        therefore essential?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally I would like Microsoft to get more involved with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. They&#8217;ve<br />
        sent very little feedback over the years, far less than the other browser<br />
        vendors. Even when asking them about their opinion on features they are<br />
        implementing I rarely get any feedback. It&#8217;s very sad. If I e-mail them a<br />
        question about how I can best help them, I usually get no reply; at best<br />
        I&#8217;ll get a promise that they&#8217;ll get back to me, but that&#8217;s it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been a lot of spirited debate (ahem) about accessibility in<br />
        the development of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. How does the spec deal with the requirements<br />
        of people with disabilities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal access&mdash;the requirement that anyone be able to use information<br />
        on the Web&mdash;is a fundamental cornerstone of <abbr>HTML</abbr>&#8216;s design, just like<br />
        security, privacy, and so on. In general, we try to design features so<br />
        that they Just Work for everyone, regardless of how you are accessing the<br />
        Web. For example, in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 we&#8217;ve added new input controls like calendars.<br />
        These will Just Work with screen readers once browsers support them,<br />
        authors don&#8217;t have to do anything special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your personal support of <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1023585606&amp;count=1">humanitarian eugenics</a> affect your opinion of giving<br />

<p> People with disabilities are just as important to me in my work on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 as is anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You wrote to ask screenreader vendors to participate in<br />
        the specification process. Did they ever reply?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple did, but only to say they had little time for the standards<br />
        process, which was quite disappointing. Since then, though, Apple has<br />
        ramped up their efforts on their built-in Mac <abbr>OS X</abbr> screen reader software,<br />
        and we <strong>do</strong> get a lot of feedback from Apple. So at least one screen<br />
        reader vendor is actively involved.</p>

<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>

<p><abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a> appear to  do the <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/04/html5-wai-aria">same thing</a> in some places.<br />
        How should developers handle this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there&#8217;s a built-in way to do something, using that is the simplest<br />
        and most reliable solution. So for example, if you want to have a<br />
        checkbox, using the <code>input</code> element with its <code>type</code> attribute set to <code>checkbox</code> is the simplest solution&mdash;it&#8217;ll work for everyone, with or<br />
        without JavaScript, with or without a screen reader, and so on. ARIA is<br />
        useful when <abbr>HTML</abbr> doesn&#8217;t let you do what you want and you find yourself<br />
        hacking around with many nested <code>div</code>s, scripting your own controls and so<br />
        forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we expect ARIA-specific constructs which have no equivalent in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, such as live regions, to be allowed under the rules of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 so it will all validate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the plan is to make sure ARIA and HTML5 work well together. Right now<br />
        I&#8217;m waiting for ARIA to be complete (there are a number of last call<br />
        comments that they haven&#8217;t yet replied to), and for the ARIA<br />
        implementation rules to be clearer (it&#8217;s not yet obvious as I understand<br />
        it what should happen when ARIA says a checkbox is a radio button, for<br />
        instance). Once that is cleared up, I expect <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will give a list of<br />
        conformance criteria saying where ARIA attributes can be used and saying<br />
        how they should be implemented in browsers.</p>

<h3>Why, when, how, who?</h3>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would we  content authors  want to move to <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5? What&#8217;s in it<br />
        for us? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is probably too early to start using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. </p>
<p> Long term, content authors will find a variety of new features in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.<br />
        We have a bunch of new structural elements like <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>footer</code>, and so on. We have new elements for embedded media, like <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>. We have new input controls, like the calendars I mentioned,<br />
        but also fields for <abbr>URL</abbr>s, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and for<br />
        color selection. We have control over autocomplete values in text fields,<br />
        as well as field validation so that you can say which fields are required.<br />
        We have context menus, <code>pushState()</code> so you can update the <abbr>URL</abbr> in Ajax<br />
        applications, and offline application cache manifests so that your users<br />
        can take your applications offline. The list goes on.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s also the benefits that come from using an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 validator. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5<br />
        is much more precise about many things than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, so the validators will<br />
        be more useful in catching real errors. The <code>embed</code> element is no longer<br />
        invalid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there advantages for end-users, too? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A more powerful <abbr>HTML</abbr> means more powerful Web applications. Just like <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> resulted in more interactive apps, <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will result in<br />
        a richer and more consistently reliable experience. I hope!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the the timeline? When can we start using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plan is to have the spec mostly finished by October 2009. A lot<br />
        depends on the browser vendors, though. I don&#8217;t know when things will be<br />
        implemented widely enough that authors can use them reliably everywhere.<br />
        Some features, like <code>canvas</code> and <code>video</code>, are getting implemented in most<br />
        browsers as we speak. Others will take longer.</p>

<p> What can standards-savvy WaSP readers do to get involved with the specification process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways of taking part. What we need most of all these<br />
        days is technical review of the specification text, calling out places<br />
        where I screwed up, where the spec defines something that&#8217;s not easy to<br />
        use for Web authors, where the spec contradicts itself, typos, spelling<br />
        mistakes, grammar errors, errors in examples, you name it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Will there ever be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, or is it a convenient fiction to park<br />
        out-of-scope discussions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, and 7, and 8, and probably many more,<br />
        until someone comes up with something so radically better that we stop<br />
        evolving the Web as we know it. </p>
<p> I expect work on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 will start even before <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is completely done, in<br />
        fact. Putting the finishing touches on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will be a long and tedious<br />
        job involving writing a massive test suite. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 never had a serious test<br />
        suite created (it was too vague as a specification to really be properly<br />
        tested), so we have to start from scratch with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. The <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 team will<br />
        at least be able to build on what we&#8217;ve done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, I&#8217;m jealous!</p>
<p> Actually if it was up to me, after <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 I would probably transition <abbr>HTML</abbr> to an incremental model. Once we have a basic spec that is well-defined<br />
        and has been proven, instead of releasing a frozen snapshot every few<br />
        years, I&#8217;d prefer a model where we can slowly evolve the language, call it<br />
        &quot;<abbr>HTML</abbr> Current&quot; or something, without having to worry about versioning it.<br />
        To some extent that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but I think formalising<br />
        it would really help.</p>
<p> Having versions of specs doesn&#8217;t make sense when you have multiple<br />
        implementations that are all evolving as well. No browser is ever going to<br />
        be exactly <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, they&#8217;ll all be subsets or supersets. So why bother with<br />
        versioning the spec?</p>
<p> It&#8217;s a very unusual idea in the standards world, so I don&#8217;t expect us to<br />
        do this. But I do think it&#8217;d be the best way forward.</p>

<p>Would you like to be the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 editor?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too early to tell! It&#8217;s been a lot of fun working on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, it&#8217;s quite<br />
        challenging and you have to deal with all kinds of issues from the deeply<br />
        technical to the highly political. I might want a change of pace when<br />
        we&#8217;re done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, though.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s your fave feature that didn&#8217;t get into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 that you&#8217;d put<br />

</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In-window modal dialogs or dialog box&mdash;the kind of prompt you get when the<br />
        computer asks you a question and won&#8217;t let you do anything else until you<br />
        answer the question. For instance, the window that comes up when you say<br />
        &quot;Save As&#8230;&quot; is usually a modal dialog.</p>
<p>Right now people fake it with <code>div</code>s and<br />
        complicated styles and script. It would be neat to just be able to say<br />
        &quot;make this section a modal dialog&quot;. Like <code>showModalDialog()</code>, but within<br />
        the page instead of opening a new window with a new page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d add it to <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but there are so many new features already that we<br />
        need to wait for the browsers to catch up.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>When in Indonesia <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/">Bruce Lawson</a>, co-lead of the Accessibility Task Force, got the opportunity to interview Widianto Nugroho from <i lang="id" xml:lang="id">Institut Teknologi Bandung</i>. What follows is the transcript of their chat as well as links to useful resources for anyone interested in web standards in Indonesia.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Take it away Bruce!</strong></p>
<p>I was recently lucky enough to travel around some universities in Indonesia, lecturing on emerging web standards as part of an <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/tours/">Opera University Tour</a>. In Indonesia, web standards are not widespread although interest is growing. One group who are really on the ball are the team behind the website of <a href="http://www.itb.ac.id/">Institut Teknologi Bandung</a>, a technology institute who hosted a lecture. I spoke to one of the team, <a href="http://www.widiantonugroho.com/">Widianto Nugroho</a> about his work, and standards in the world&#8217;s third most populous country.</p>
<h3>How big is the <abbr title="Institut Teknologi Bandung">ITB</abbr> web team?</h3>
<p> Our team consists of five people, two web designers, and three programmers. We are responsible for development of web application of the <abbr title="Institut Teknologi Bandung">ITB</abbr> website as well as maintaining its day-to-day operation. Websites of other sub-units (faculties, schools, programs, offices, etc.)  are run by each unit&#8217;s webmasters/admins. We work with other teams, such as the reporter team that is responsible for the content, and sys admin team that responsible for  running the servers.</p>
<h3>When and why did you decide to use web standards?</h3>
<p> Tableless layout was implemented in 2004. Before that, we still used tables for layout purposes due to the lack of browser support before that time, but  used valid tags and a proper doctype. We use web standards because:</p>
<ul>
<li> we want our web site to be accessible with any browser. During the browser wars, we decided that this was the right direction for developing our site. </li>
<li> we need interoperability in our information system. There are many applications developed by many teams. The <abbr title="Institut Teknologi Bandung">ITB</abbr> main website is just one of those applications. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Did you meet your goals by using the standards?</h3>
<p> Yes. standards make our web works better in any browser, and they give us a good foundation for developing our website  in the future.</p>
<h3>What is the hardest part about trying to use standards?</h3>
<p> It is hard, trying to use standards in the beginning. After that, our job became a lot more easier with standards; we can make any improvement more easily.</p>
<h3>Do you have any connection with the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>?</h3>
<p>No, not yet, but my team has proposed <abbr>ITB</abbr> to join <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> in the next year. I hope <abbr title="Institut Teknologi Bandung">ITB</abbr> can participate in the development of standards, especially for web technologies for developing countries.</p>
<h3>Looking more broadly, how wide-spread are standards in Indonesia? Why? What could be done to encourage use of standards?</h3>
<p> I don&#8217;t know exactly, but some of web designers/developers and blogger activists that I know are very concerned about web standards. What could be done is through education and workshops about <strong>why</strong> web standards are important.</p>
<h3>What are the biggest challenges facing the web in Indonesia today? </h3>
<p>The biggest challenges in my opinion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the habit of developers, especially those who come from pre-tableless era.</li>
<li>there are no government regulations  relating to the technical implementation of the web, such as regulation for governmental websites. The government policy that relates to the IT area is  legislation called <i lang="id" xml:lang="id">Undang-undang tentang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik</i> or the Law Information and Electronic Transactions, which does not cover web standards, browser compatibility or accessibility issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are web standards taught in schools, universities and other places of education?</h3>
<p>No. In secondary school level, there is a vocational type of school that specializes in Informatics/Computer Science (<i lang="id" xml:lang="id">Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan Informatika/SMK Informatika</i>) where web design and development are taught. However, the content of the curriculum in this level is more concentrated on the Web in general, how to build it, and make use of the available tools/software. </p>
<p>The educational system currently employed in primary and secondary schools in Indonesia is decentralized in nature. With this system each educational unit (school) can tailor their own curriculum based on their localities, needs, etc. Hence, the implementation of the web design/development curriculum can be different from one school to another. It is similar to the higher education system; for example, in the Informatics Program here at <abbr title="Institut Teknologi Bandung">ITB</abbr> there is no course about web standards, neither is there in our Visual Communication Design Program.</p>
<p>In other  places, most of the courses relate to the tools/software, programming languages and databases such as <abbr title="Acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>/My<abbr>SQL</abbr>, or to particular platform such as .NET.</p>
<h3>How aware is the average web designer about web standards and, if not, why not?</h3>
<p> I believe that  awareness  of web standards is growing among web designers in Indonesia. However, I can&#8217;t yet say  that all of the designers are using web standards properly. Some designers are submitting their work to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> showcase such us the CSSmania.com, etc. This situation is supported by significant contributions by some individuals who promote  web standards through blogs,  mailing lists and forums.</p>
<h3>Are there many resources in Bahasa Indonesian?</h3>
<p>There are some resources:</p>
<h4>Mailing list/Forums:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Massive Lab Forum massivelab.com (design in general)</li>
<li> Teknologia @googlegroups (information technology in general)</li>
<li> WebPM @yahoogroups (practicing web designers/developers)</li>
<li> WordPress Indonesia @googlegroups</li>
<li> Drupal Indonesia @drupal.org</li>
</ul>
<h4>Blogs: </h4>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://avianto.com">Boy Avianto</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://orangescale.net">Thomas Arie Setiawan </a></li>
<li><a href="http://daniiswara.net">Dani Iswara</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Who are the influential bloggers?</h3>
<p>Influential bloggers that I know:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://enda.goblogmedia.com">Enda Nasution</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://priyadi.net">Priyadi Iman Nurcahyo</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://direktif.web.id">Ikhlasul Amal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rahard.wordpress.com"> Budi Rahardo</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A huge thank you from <abbr title="The Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr> and for taking the time to be interviewed, and for carrying the web standards torch in Indonesia!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always on the look out for translations of good resources into multiple languages so it&#8217;s great to see the <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a> starting to be translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Hungarian, Italian and Russian.</p>
<p>The curriculum, which will work in parallel with the upcoming <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2008/07/31/announcing-the-wasp-curriculum-framework/">Web Standards Framework</a> from WaSP, is a set of fifty-five articles covering everything from the history of web standards and why they matter through to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility and much more.</p>
<p>One of the most important things for us in the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/ilg/">International Liaison Group</a> is to support the translation of good resources in multiple languages. If you&#8217;re interested in either reading translations or helping with the translations themselves check out the  list of <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/web-standards-curriculum-translations/">Web Standards Curriculum translations</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I work for Opera as a Web Evangelist but am posting this as I truly think the Web Standards Curriculum is a great resource drawing on the expertise of some great people across the industry.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You  might remember that I published a post called <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2008/09/08/uk-government-draft-browser-guidance-is-daft-browser-guidance/"><abbr>UK</abbr> government draft browser guidance is daft browser guidance</a> last September, calling out a draft document outlining some <abbr>UK</abbr> government browser testing guidelines.</p>
<p>These suggested that for government web sites,  webmasters need not test in less popular browsers (those with less than 2% in that site&#8217;s usage statistics) and that there should be a page on the site listing the popular browsers which had been tested with the message &#8220;We advise you to upgrade your browser version as far as your computer allows and if possible to one of those listed above&#8221;.</p>
<p>I called on readers to email the consultation address and object that the guidelines did not advocate web standards and methodologies like progressive enhancement to ensure that all browsers were served. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/09/uk_gvt_browser_guidelines/">The Register carried the story</a>, and   two days after I made that call, the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2008/09/08/uk-government-draft-browser-guidance-is-daft-browser-guidance/#comment-72086">author of the guidelines, Adam Bailin, commented</a> that over 400 people had already emailed him.</p>
<p>Last Friday, 16 January, Adam published the <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=213">revised browser testing guidelines</a>, and he&#8217;s done a great job of including best-practice development. The guidelines point to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml#support_table"><abbr>BBC</abbr>&#8216;s support table</a> as a good example of graded browser support, and notes the <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=215">importance of supporting standards-compliant browsers (paragraphs 17-18)</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=215"><p>Coding a site to web standards should ensure that any browser that supports web standards will render and behave as intended. Therefore your browser testing matrix must include browsers that support web standards.</p>
<p>You should follow a progressive enhancement approach to developing websites to ensure that content is accessible to the widest possible number of browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of valid code is noted (<a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=215">paragraphs 21-23</a>): </p>
<blockquote><p>All <abbr>(X)HTML</abbr> content must validate with respect to your chosen <abbr>DTD</abbr>.</p>
<p>You must use valid <abbr>CSS</abbr> for the presentational layer of your website including layout and styling. <abbr>(X)HTML</abbr> tables should only be used for presenting tables of data.</p>
<p>Code used for adding richness to the user interface (e.g. JavaScript, ActionScript) must be ECMAScript-compliant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guidelines now emphasise functionality over identical layout across browsers (<a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=217">paragraph 39</a>):</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=217"><p>You should check that the content, functionality and display all work as intended. There may be minor differences in the way that the website is displayed. The intent is not that it should be pixel perfect across browsers, but that a user of a particular browser does not notice anything appears wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Graceful degradation without scripting/ plug-ins and accessibility are required (<a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=217">paragraphs 41-42</a>)</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=217"><p>You should also test your website to make sure that it works with scripting and plug-ins turned off.</p>
<p>Some users will be unable to use pointing devices so you should verify that the site works using a keyboard only.</p>

<p>I could be churlish and quibble about a couple of points in the document that I personally disagree with, but I won&#8217;t; the philosophical framework of the new Guidelines is a scalable, future-proof  one that will properly serve taxpayers, web visitors and government webmasters in the <abbr>UK</abbr>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to congratulate Adam Bailin and the team who revised the guidelines, and I&#8217;d like to congratulate every one of the 400+ readers who took the time and the trouble to write and support web standards. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a job well done.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not often that Web folk are asked to give money to support Web Standards, so when the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> asks, we ought to listen up.</p>
<p>The W3C has launched the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Donate">W3C Validator Donation Program</a> to give Web people and organizations the opportunity to support what must be one of the most commonly used tools by those in our profession. </p>
<p>Think about it &#8212; how many times a week do you ping one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/">validators</a> to check your HTML, CSS, or feeds? Don&#8217;t you occasionally run the link checker on your site to find broken links? If you&#8217;re like me or any of the designers or developers I know, you probably rely on these services a fair bit.</p>
<p>As explained by Olivier Théreaux in <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/12/validator_donation_program.html">his recent blog post</a>, the donation program isn&#8217;t about paying for bandwidth or servers, it&#8217;s about continuing to improve the validators to support new languages, to fix bugs, and to add new features. </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get in the holiday spirit and give to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Donate">W3C Validator Donation Program</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Donate"><img src="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/I_heart_validator_lg" alt="I heart Validator" title="W3C Validator Donation Program" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 9.5 years of work, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> have reached <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendation status. On behalf of the WaSP Accessibility Task Force, I&#8217;d like to welcome <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2 officially into the pantheon of Web standards.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://twitter.com/caledoniaman/statuses/1051579708">this tweet by caledoniaman</a> sums up the level of anticipation:</p>
<blockquote><p>WCAG 2.0 and a new Guns &#8216;n&#8217; Roses album in the same year. What&#8217;s the world coming to.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting comparison. They&#8217;ve each had about as many pre-releases. In any case, I can say, having spent over 8 years with it, that WCAG 2 is not as entertaining as Chinese Democracy. But I do think that it&#8217;s better equipped to stand the test of time. </p>
<p>If I had to pick one thing I&#8217;m most happy about, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s that the HTML- and text-centrism in WCAG 1 is largely gone. In its place is a much more flexible (dare I say robust?) concept of accessibility-supported technology. So when newer technologies can show themselves to be directly accessible, they too can be used in WCAG 2-conformant content.</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have conflated &#8220;WCAG-conformant&#8221; with &#8220;accessible,&#8221; and that&#8217;s led to people making statements like: &#8220;Don&#8217;t use JavaScript&#8211;it&#8217;s inaccessible.&#8221; That&#8217;s bad for everyone, from users with disabilities who actually can work with JavaScript (which is to say, the vast majority), to Web designers and developers, to policymakers, to those developing new technologies.</p>
<p>With WCAG 2, &#8220;Don&#8217;t use x&#8221; is no longer valid. (Was it ever?) It is now up to you, the developer, to work on the direct accessibility of your content, no matter what technology you choose. I believe we&#8217;re about to experience a new wave of accessible design techniques, as a result.</p>
<p>But first, we need to flush &#8220;Don&#8217;t use x&#8221; out of our system. Some are accustomed to saying it about anything they&#8217;re not comfortable with. That&#8217;s only holding accessible design back. It&#8217;s time to learn what&#8217;s out there, today, and use it in everyday Web design. It&#8217;s time to make everyone&#8217;s Web more accessible. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 Recommendation</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">its supporting material</a>. Then, start thinking about what a more accessible Web could be. We still have a lot of work to do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-mobileOK-basic10-tests-20081103/">mobileOK Basic Tests</a> specifications have been moved to &#8220;proposed recommendation status&#8221; by the <abbr>W3C</abbr>, which  means that the technical material  is complete and it has been implemented in real sites. </p>
<h3>WCAG 2</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/11/with_real_world_implementation.html">Shawn Henry writes</a> of <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2,</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/11/with_real_world_implementation.html"><p>Over the last few months, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Working Group has been going through a process to ensure that WCAG 2.0 can be implemented. Developers and dsigners from around the world gave WCAG 2.0 a &#8220;test drive&#8221; in their own Web content.</p>
<p>The result: Successful implementations in a wide range of sites including education, commerce, government, and a blog; in languages including Japanese, German, English, and French; and using a wide range of technologies including scripting, multimedia, Flash, and WAI-ARIA. You can get the nitty-gritty details from the Implementation Report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that WCAG 2 could be the new accessibility standard by Christmas. What does that mean for you? The answer: it depends. If your approach to accessibility has  been one of guidelines and ticking against checkpoints, you&#8217;ll need some reworking your test plans as the priorities, checkpoints and surrounding structures  have changed from <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 1. But if your site was developed with an eye to real accessibility for real people rather than as a compliance issue, you should find that there is little difference.</p>
<h3>mobileOK Basic Tests</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this largely so you don&#8217;t have the same worries with them that I did. Crudely speaking, they&#8217;re an automated test  that a site will be OK on a very low-spec mobile mobile device called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#ddc">Default Delivery Context</a>&#8221; (<abbr>DDC</abbr>) so there are certain rules in the validator such as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-mobileOK-basic10-tests-20081103/#PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT">page cannot be larger than 20K</a>. This caused me some degree of tizzy,  until I read the caveats at the top of the specicaton:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/PR-mobileOK-basic10-tests-20081103/"><p>mobileOK Basic primarily assesses basic usability, efficiency and interoperability. It does not address the important goal of assessing whether users of more advanced devices enjoy a richer user experience than is possible using the <abbr>DDC</abbr>.</p>
<p>&hellip;The Best Practices, and hence the tests, are not promoted as guidance for achieving the optimal user experience. The capabilities of many devices exceed those defined by the <abbr>DDC</abbr>. It will often be possible, and generally desirable, to provide an experience designed to take advantage of the extra capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my advice: make your pages as long as the content requires, no longer or shorter. Use the images that the content and design needs, and let the user decide whether he or she wishes to accept your images. Make sure all images that convey information have explanatory alternative text  for those who can&#8217;t consume your images. </p>
<p>Now that sounds familiar&hellip;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This blog post is superseded by <a href="/2009/01/19/uk-government-browser-guidelines-good-sense-prevails/">UK government browser guidelines: good sense prevails</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Last friday, the UK government&#8217;s Central Office of Information (<abbr>COI</abbr>) published a <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=200">public consultation on browser standards for public sector websites</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guidance has been developed to assist those delivering public sector websites to determine which web browsers to use for testing. Public sector websites have a responsibility to be inclusive and not exclude groups of users but it would be impractical to test websites on every available browser. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, so apparently reasonable. I&#8217;m  pleased to see that the <abbr>COI</abbr>  advises that browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux be tested, that assistive technologies be tested, and it&#8217;s good that the draft guidance recognises that different sites have different target audiences.</p>
<p>But the central premise of the draft guidelines is <strong>fundamentally flawed</strong>.</p>
<h4>Playing the numbers game</h4>
<p>The central message of the draft guidelines (which are not available in <abbr>HTML</abbr>, only <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/documents/guidance/browser-standards-draft-v0-13.doc">Word (280K)</a> and <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/documents/guidance/browser-standards-draft-v0-13.pdf"><abbr>PDF</abbr> (160K)</a>) is that <strong>public sector webmasters need not test in less-popular browsers</strong>. </p>
<p>If a browser  appears in visitor logs as being below an arbitrary percentage of total &#8220;unique visitors&#8221; then it should not be listed as being &#8220;fully supported&#8221; in the site&#8217;s accessibility or help pages.
</p>
<p>
It <em>may</em> be listed as &quot;semi-supported&quot;, which is defined: &quot;A browser is semi-supported if the content and navigation works but the  website does not display as intended&#8221;. Intended by whom? Are we back to the bad old days when webmasters strove for pixel-perfect rendering, even on governmental sites which are largely content-driven rather than design-dependant?</p>
<h4>This page is best viewed with Browser X</h4>
<p>The <abbr>COI</abbr> says &#8220;Avoid using statements such as, &#8216;this page is best viewed with Browser X&#8217;&quot;, and then goes on to advocate pushing users to change their browser.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people use minority browsers, like Opera, Flock, Camino, OminWeb, Konqueror and the like (<a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/blawson/#disclosure">full disclosure</a>: I work for Opera). A large percentage of visitors to the WaSP website use browsers other than the Web&#8217;s most numerically popular browser, for professional or political reasons. Others  use a smaller browser for accessibility reasons, or because it&#8217;s familiar, or because they prefer the user interface, or just because they  like it. Choice and personal preference is the heart of an open Web.</p>
<p>But the<abbr> COI</abbr> believes that it&#8217;s legitimate to suggest that visitors to government websites should change their preference, working methods and computer setup because of its testing policy. The example browser support policy statement, that they advise publishing on an accessiiblity or help page, says (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Website name]  has been tested on a wide range of browsers:</p>
<p>[List supported  browsers here]</p>
<p><strong>We advise you  to upgrade your browser version as far as your computer allows and if  possible to one of those listed above</strong>. However, the following  browsers should also provide access to all of the content and  navigation on the site:</p>
<p>[List  semi-supported browsers here]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, in order to save costs on testing, the <abbr>COI</abbr> is advocates  browser upgrade. By encouraging people to move from minority browsers to majority browsers, it works against the minority browsers ever increasing their market share in that sector, and the public sector is a big sector. It also sets a terrible example to organisations outside the public sector who are only just being cajoled out of the &#8220;build for <abbr>IE</abbr>&#8221; mindset.</p>
<h4>Swimming against the tide</h4>
<p>In the introduction to a document that wishes to help webmasters save money by limiting the range of browsers used for testing, it says that &quot;how to code for browser compatibility&quot; is &quot;out of scope&quot;. This is bizarre; how can the single most effective way to reduce the cost of development be considered out of scope? This goes completely against the recent rise of the standards movement led by the WaSP, which was founded in 1998 to fight for standards that reduce the cost and complexity of development.
</p>
<p>The guidelines note</p>
<blockquote><p>
These guidelines  do not advocate specific development methodologies, for example graceful degradation or progressive enhancement.  However, it is widely accepted that sites conforming to open web  standards such as XHTML and CSS are more likely to work well across a  wide range of browsers. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is entirely back-to-front. The guidelines <em>should</em> be advocating a specific development methodology: they <em>should</em> recommend designing to Web Standards.  Costs will be driven down, even if testing is performed across more browsers, because there will be fewer inconsistencies and less recoding to fix inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The <abbr>COI</abbr> should also advocate publishing information in open formats, such as <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and practice what it preaches.</p>
<h4>Respond to the consultation</h4>
<p>All <abbr>UK</abbr> and European developers have the right to <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/contact.php?contact=48">respond to this consultation</a>, which closes October 17, 2008. We hope that you will do so, because UK government websites have a <a href="http://www.blether.com/archives/2007/04/dti_update_good.php">lamentable track record</a>, and we invite you to post your response on your site and link to it in the comments below, to inspire others.</p>
