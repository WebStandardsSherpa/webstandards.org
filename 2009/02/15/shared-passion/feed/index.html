		<description>Thanks so much for participating Derek, and for the great words here. It really was an amazing day, and I can&#039;t over state just how much work Aaron, Stephanie and Chris in particular put into it, nor the fantastic outcomes from the day.

We&#039;ll be posting all the resources from the event - slides, guides, and even video, shortly. 

Really looking forward to seeing the launch of what the WaSP Edu TF has been doing - it really is amazingly impressive.

Lots of great things afoot in this space
