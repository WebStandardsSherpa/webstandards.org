		<description>Oh yes, one more thing. Safari 4 does not work with my trackpoint. Bummer! That is a deal breaker in usability. I do appreciate that it has got a native Windows look, though.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t twitter, so I&#039;ll post it here. Safari 4 still does not render this SVG correctly: http://keryx.se/dev/svg/geckobug-08-01/ie8-metatag.html

It is explained at http://keryx.se/dev/svg/geckobug-08-01/

The bug is still open. http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17053</description>

		<description>This is all so new, I&#039;m still concerned that authors will go straight to the specs and get turned off from understanding the basics. The Best Practices Guide isn&#039;t a bad place to start though. But, I think we need to good job of advertising all the ARIA resources out there! For example, there is the codetalks.org website which points to lots of other resources, and has test cases to play with.

There is also the free-aria mailing list on Google Groups! http://groups.google.com/group/free-aria</description>

		<description>Hi Derek, thanks for signposting to the questions...the more constructive feedback the group gets the better. Just one thing though, the questions are actually from Micheal Cooper over at W3C which he said I could share with folk as a bit of a guideline.

That said, congrats to the group, having WAI-ARIA complete and out there is going to be a massive step forward.

In the following discussion, Stuart Langridge -another speaker at the event- discussed an ARIA stylesheet, which he argued would help add ARIA support to existing sites with little effort. He has placed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/02/22/a-wai-aria-stylesheet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;working concept of an ARIA stylesheet&lt;/a&gt; on his blog.</description>
