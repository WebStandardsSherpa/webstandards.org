			<p>You&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s coming in 2012. Or maybe 2022. It&#8217;s certainly <a href="http://ishtml5readyyet.com/">not ready yet</a>, but some parts are already in browsers <strong>now</strong> so for the standards-savvy  developers, the future is worth investigating today. <a href="/about/members/hixie/">Ian &#8220;Hixie&#8221; Hickson</a>, editor of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 specification, hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft  in October <strong>this year</strong>.</p>
<p>Accessibility Task Force member, <a href="/about/members/blawson/">Bruce Lawson</a>, interviews Hixie on how the specification for the next generation of the Web&#8217;s markup language is shaping up. Disclosure of affiliations: both work for browser vendors&mdash;Bruce  for Opera, Hixie  for Google (and previously, Opera and Netscape).</p>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spec now known as <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 began with a &quot;guerilla&quot; group called <abbr>WHATWG</abbr>. How and why did the <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> begin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer is the <abbr>W3C</abbr> told us to. </p>
<p> The long answer: Back in 2003, when XForms was going through its final<br />
        stages (the &quot;Proposed Recommendation&quot; vote stage), the browser vendors<br />
        were concerned that it wouldn&#8217;t take off on the Web without being made a<br />
        part of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and out of that big discussion (which unfortunately is<br />
        mostly hidden behind the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s confidentiality walls) came a proof of<br />
        concept showing that it was possible to take some of XForms&#8217; ideas and put<br />
        then into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4. We originally called it &quot;XForms Basic&quot;, and later renamed<br />
        it &quot;WebForms 2.0&quot;. This formed the basis of what is now <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.</p>
<p> In 2004, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had a workshop, the &quot;The <abbr>W3C</abbr> Workshop on Web Applications<br />
        and Compound Documents&quot;, where we (the browser vendors) argued that it was<br />
        imperative that <abbr>HTML</abbr> be extended in a backwards-compatible way. It was a<br />
        turning point in the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s history&mdash;you could tell because at one point<br />
        RedHat, Sun, and Microsoft, arch-rivals all, actually agreed on something,<br />
        and that <b>never</b> happens.</p>
<p> The outcome of that workshop was that the <abbr>W3C</abbr> concluded that <abbr>HTML</abbr> was<br />
        still dead, as had been decided in a workshop in 1998, and that if we<br />
        wanted to do something like <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, we should go elsewhere. So we announced<br />
        a mailing list, and did it there.</p>
<p>At the time I was working for Opera Software, but &quot;we&quot; in this case was<br />
        Opera and Mozilla acting together (with Apple cheering us from the<br />
        sidelines).</p>

<p>How did you become editor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p> I was at the right place at the right time and everyone else was too busy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you personally go about editing the spec and  incorporating<br />
        feedback? What are your processes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has varied over the years, as we&#8217;ve gone from a nascent organisation<br />
        with a few dozen people to a well-established project with a mailing list<br />
        with 900+ subscribers. Mostly it&#8217;s all down to managing e-mail. When<br />
        someone writes feedback on the spec, whether by sending an e-mail to one<br />
        of the mailing lists I&#8217;m on, or by blogging somewhere, or twittering, I<br />
        log their feedback in a folder on my IMAP server. Feedback gets<br />
        categorised into either feedback I can work on right away, or feedback<br />
        that I can&#8217;t deal with yet for whatever reason. An example of the latter<br />
        would be requests relating to mutation events, because I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
        DOM3 Events to update how mutation events work. </p>
<p> Then, I just go through all the feedback I have, e-mail by e-mail, more or<br />
        less in the order that I received them, sending replies and fixing the<br />
        spec to address the issues that were raised.</p>
<p> This has some disadvantages, for example there&#8217;s a big delay in between<br />
        when someone spots an error and when I fix it. It also has some really<br />
        important advantages. If I respond to feedback on something I wrote<br />
        straight after writing it, I sometimes find that I have an attachment to<br />
        that section, so if someone suggests a total replacement, I tend to not<br />
        like their idea. But if I have a delay, I find my attachment has gone<br />
        away, and I&#8217;m eager to replace my old stupid idea with their better one.<br />
        (Assuming it&#8217;s better, anyway!) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the hardest thing to do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few things that are hard. One is saying &quot;no&quot; to people who have<br />
        clearly spent the time to come up with a good idea. The sad truth is that<br />
        I reject almost everything that I and anyone else thinks of, because if I<br />
        didn&#8217;t, the spec would be a thousand times more bloated than it is now. We<br />
        get proposals for all kinds of things, and we have to have a very high bar<br />
        for what goes in. There&#8217;s also the danger that if we add too many things<br />
        to the spec too quickly, the browser vendors will each implement their own<br />
        bit and it&#8217;ll be a big mess that won&#8217;t help Web authors. </p>
<p> So I have to make judgements about what is worth adding and what isn&#8217;t,<br />
        and that&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ve upset a lot of people by rejecting their ideas,<br />
        because they take it personally. On the other hand, some of the most<br />
        productive members of the community now are people who&#8217;ve had many of<br />
        their ideas rejected, but they stuck around long enough to see a few of<br />
        their ideas make it in. The best way to get an idea into the spec is to<br />
        find something in the spec that&#8217;s just clearly wrong, which is something<br />
        that a lot of the most active people do a lot, too!</p>
<p> Something else that&#8217;s hard is making up new features. The bulk of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is<br />
        actually just defining how browsers already do things, which, although<br />
        complicated and sometimes unbelievably arcane, is, at the end of the day,<br />
        pretty easy to spec: you test the browsers, and you write what they do.<br />
        Rinse, repeat, until the spec covers every possible case.</p>
<p> Making up new features, though, means actually thinking about what should<br />
        happen, what is the most understandable solution, figuring out how things<br />
        should fit together, and so on. It&#8217;s often tempting to make something that<br />
        is theoretically neat, but which doesn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the<br />
        language, too. After all, that&#8217;s where all this came from&mdash;we don&#8217;t want<br />
        to create a new XForms, a really well-designed technology that doesn&#8217;t fit<br />
        into the way people write pages. </p>

Why  is it so important to do so, and isn&#8217;t it a lost cause given that those  techologies are already out there while <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is not yet complete?</p>

<p>HTML 4 is also in direct competition with proprietary technologies, and<br />
        it&#8217;s winning, hands-down. HTML5 is just continuing the battle, because if<br />
        we don&#8217;t keep up, then the proprietary technologies will gain ground.</p>

<p>What else did <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> try to achieve with this new iteration of <abbr>HTML</abbr>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started from trying to put features from XForms into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, and we<br />
        quickly also took the opportunity to fix some of the things in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 that<br />
        were either too vague or disagreed with reality (that is, where the<br />
        browsers all did one thing but the spec said another). It turns out that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is so vague that this is a pretty big task&mdash;it even involved<br />
        defining the whole <abbr>HTML</abbr> parsing model, including error handling, which is<br />
        a huge job (it took me the better part of a month to write the first<br />
        draft, and we were tweaking it for about a year before it become more or<br />
        less stable).</p>
<p>Something else we&#8217;ve tried to do is make things simpler. We&#8217;ve simplified<br />
        the syntax (e.g. the rules about what can be quoted, what strings are<br />
        valid <code>id</code>s, etc, are much simpler now). We&#8217;ve made things which people<br />
        used to do in JavaScript have shortcuts, so now you can just say <code>autofocus=&quot;&quot;</code> to focus a form field when the page loads, instead of using <code>control.focus()</code>, which allows the browser to do clever things like not<br />
        actually focus the control if the user is already typing elsewhere.</p>

<p><cite>Hixie:</cite></p>

<p>No, <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 actually makes the rules for markup even stricter than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 in<br />
        many ways, both for authors (the rules are simpler, but stricter, than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4&#8242;s) and for implementers (gone are the days where they can just do<br />
        whatever they want when handling parse errors, now every browser has to<br />
        act the same). </p>
<p> Hopefully, we&#8217;ve managed to make the rules on what is valid syntax more<br />
        understandable, which should help with getting more good markup. We&#8217;ve<br />
        also made it possible to write clearer validators, so I have high hopes.</p>

<p> Does including JavaScript and DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 spec dilute the<br />
        message about separating behaviour and structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know about a message about separating behaviour and structure, I<br />
        must have missed that memo! <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 takes a pretty hard line on separating<br />
        style and presentation from structure and semantics; there are no more <code>font</code> tags. Separating the logic and behaviour from the structure and<br />
        semantics of an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document isn&#8217;t as important, generally, as far as I<br />
        can tell. </p>
<p> The main advantage of defining the <abbr>HTML</abbr> DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements in<br />
        the same specification is that we don&#8217;t let stuff fall through the cracks.<br />
        In practice, browsers implement the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements as DOM nodes, there&#8217;s no<br />
        difference. When we separate the two in the specs, therefore, we introduce<br />
        a conceptual gap where there isn&#8217;t one in reality. The DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> spec, for<br />
        instance, doesn&#8217;t say what happens when you change the <code>type</code> attribute of<br />
        an <code>input</code> element <code>from</code> text  to <code>checkbox</code> on the fly, and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4<br />
        spec doesn&#8217;t mention that changing attributes on the fly is possible, so<br />
        in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 / DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> era, there&#8217;s a big hole there. In <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, this is<br />
        all defined together, so we can tighten this up and make sure there are no<br />
        gaps.</p>

<p>Why no native support for microformats/ <abbr>RDFa</abbr> in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5?</p>

<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microformats is natively supported in HTML5, just like it was in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,<br />
        because Microformats use the built-in extension mechanisms of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.</p>
<p>We considered RDFa long and hard (in fact this is an issue that&#8217;s a hot<br />
        topic right now), but at the end of the day, while some people really like<br />
        it, I don&#8217;t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of<br />
        authoring. For example, it uses namespaces and prefixes, which by and<br />
        large confuse authors to no end. Just recently though I proposed something<br />
        of a compromise which takes some of <abbr>RDFa</abbr>&#8216;s better ideas and puts them into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused<br />
        people to invent <abbr>RDFa</abbr>. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the browser vendors have the ultimate veto on<br />
        everything in the spec, since if they don&#8217;t implement it, the spec is<br />
        nothing but a work of fiction. So they have a lot of influence&mdash;I don&#8217;t<br />
        want to be writing fiction, I want to be writing a spec that documents the<br />
        actual behaviour of browsers. </p>
<p> Whether that&#8217;s too much, I don&#8217;t know. Does gravity have too much<br />
        influence on objects on earth? It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>

        therefore essential?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I would like Microsoft to get more involved with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. They&#8217;ve<br />
        sent very little feedback over the years, far less than the other browser<br />
        vendors. Even when asking them about their opinion on features they are<br />
        implementing I rarely get any feedback. It&#8217;s very sad. If I e-mail them a<br />
        question about how I can best help them, I usually get no reply; at best<br />
        I&#8217;ll get a promise that they&#8217;ll get back to me, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal access&mdash;the requirement that anyone be able to use information<br />

        security, privacy, and so on. In general, we try to design features so<br />
        that they Just Work for everyone, regardless of how you are accessing the<br />
        Web. For example, in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 we&#8217;ve added new input controls like calendars.<br />
        These will Just Work with screen readers once browsers support them,<br />

<p>When there&#8217;s a built-in way to do something, using that is the simplest<br />

        checkbox, using the <code>input</code> element with its <code>type</code> attribute set to <code>checkbox</code> is the simplest solution&mdash;it&#8217;ll work for everyone, with or<br />
        without JavaScript, with or without a screen reader, and so on. ARIA is<br />
        useful when <abbr>HTML</abbr> doesn&#8217;t let you do what you want and you find yourself<br />
        hacking around with many nested <code>div</code>s, scripting your own controls and so<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the plan is to make sure ARIA and HTML5 work well together. Right now<br />
        I&#8217;m waiting for ARIA to be complete (there are a number of last call<br />
        comments that they haven&#8217;t yet replied to), and for the ARIA<br />
        implementation rules to be clearer (it&#8217;s not yet obvious as I understand<br />
        it what should happen when ARIA says a checkbox is a radio button, for<br />
        instance). Once that is cleared up, I expect <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will give a list of<br />
        conformance criteria saying where ARIA attributes can be used and saying<br />
        how they should be implemented in browsers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is probably too early to start using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. </p>
<p> Long term, content authors will find a variety of new features in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.<br />
        We have a bunch of new structural elements like <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>footer</code>, and so on. We have new elements for embedded media, like <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>. We have new input controls, like the calendars I mentioned,<br />
        but also fields for <abbr>URL</abbr>s, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and for<br />
        color selection. We have control over autocomplete values in text fields,<br />
        as well as field validation so that you can say which fields are required.<br />
        We have context menus, <code>pushState()</code> so you can update the <abbr>URL</abbr> in Ajax<br />
        applications, and offline application cache manifests so that your users<br />
        can take your applications offline. The list goes on.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s also the benefits that come from using an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 validator. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5<br />
        is much more precise about many things than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, so the validators will<br />
        be more useful in catching real errors. The <code>embed</code> element is no longer<br />
        invalid.</p>

<p>Are there advantages for end-users, too? </p>

<p>A more powerful <abbr>HTML</abbr> means more powerful Web applications. Just like <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> resulted in more interactive apps, <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will result in<br />

<p> Will there ever be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, or is it a convenient fiction to park<br />
        out-of-scope discussions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, and 7, and 8, and probably many more,<br />
        until someone comes up with something so radically better that we stop<br />
        evolving the Web as we know it. </p>
<p> I expect work on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 will start even before <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is completely done, in<br />
        fact. Putting the finishing touches on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will be a long and tedious<br />
        job involving writing a massive test suite. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 never had a serious test<br />
        suite created (it was too vague as a specification to really be properly<br />
        tested), so we have to start from scratch with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. The <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 team will<br />
        at least be able to build on what we&#8217;ve done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, I&#8217;m jealous!</p>
<p> Actually if it was up to me, after <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 I would probably transition <abbr>HTML</abbr> to an incremental model. Once we have a basic spec that is well-defined<br />
        and has been proven, instead of releasing a frozen snapshot every few<br />
        years, I&#8217;d prefer a model where we can slowly evolve the language, call it<br />
        &quot;<abbr>HTML</abbr> Current&quot; or something, without having to worry about versioning it.<br />
        To some extent that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but I think formalising<br />
        it would really help.</p>
<p> Having versions of specs doesn&#8217;t make sense when you have multiple<br />
        implementations that are all evolving as well. No browser is ever going to<br />
        be exactly <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, they&#8217;ll all be subsets or supersets. So why bother with<br />
        versioning the spec?</p>
<p> It&#8217;s a very unusual idea in the standards world, so I don&#8217;t expect us to<br />
        do this. But I do think it&#8217;d be the best way forward.</p>
