			<p>You&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s coming in 2012. Or maybe 2022. It&#8217;s certainly <a href="http://ishtml5readyyet.com/">not ready yet</a>, but some parts are already in browsers <strong>now</strong> so for the standards-savvy  developers, the future is worth investigating today. <a href="../../../../about/members/hixie/index.html">Ian &#8220;Hixie&#8221; Hickson</a>, editor of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 specification, hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft  in October <strong>this year</strong>.</p>
<p>Accessibility Task Force member, <a href="../../../../about/members/blawson/index.html">Bruce Lawson</a>, interviews Hixie on how the specification for the next generation of the Web&#8217;s markup language is shaping up. Disclosure of affiliations: both work for browser vendors&mdash;Bruce  for Opera, Hixie  for Google (and previously, Opera and Netscape).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The spec now known as <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 began with a &quot;guerilla&quot; group called <abbr>WHATWG</abbr>. How and why did the <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> begin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer is the <abbr>W3C</abbr> told us to. </p>
<p> The long answer: Back in 2003, when XForms was going through its final<br />
        stages (the &quot;Proposed Recommendation&quot; vote stage), the browser vendors<br />
        were concerned that it wouldn&#8217;t take off on the Web without being made a<br />
        part of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and out of that big discussion (which unfortunately is<br />
        mostly hidden behind the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s confidentiality walls) came a proof of<br />
        concept showing that it was possible to take some of XForms&#8217; ideas and put<br />
        then into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4. We originally called it &quot;XForms Basic&quot;, and later renamed<br />
        it &quot;WebForms 2.0&quot;. This formed the basis of what is now <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.</p>
<p> In 2004, the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had a workshop, the &quot;The <abbr>W3C</abbr> Workshop on Web Applications<br />
        and Compound Documents&quot;, where we (the browser vendors) argued that it was<br />
        imperative that <abbr>HTML</abbr> be extended in a backwards-compatible way. It was a<br />
        turning point in the <abbr>W3C</abbr>&#8216;s history&mdash;you could tell because at one point<br />
        RedHat, Sun, and Microsoft, arch-rivals all, actually agreed on something,<br />
        and that <b>never</b> happens.</p>
<p> The outcome of that workshop was that the <abbr>W3C</abbr> concluded that <abbr>HTML</abbr> was<br />
        still dead, as had been decided in a workshop in 1998, and that if we<br />
        wanted to do something like <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, we should go elsewhere. So we announced<br />
        a mailing list, and did it there.</p>
<p>At the time I was working for Opera Software, but &quot;we&quot; in this case was<br />
        Opera and Mozilla acting together (with Apple cheering us from the<br />
        sidelines).</p>

<p>How did you become editor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p> I was at the right place at the right time and everyone else was too busy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you personally go about editing the spec and  incorporating<br />
        feedback? What are your processes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has varied over the years, as we&#8217;ve gone from a nascent organisation<br />
        with a few dozen people to a well-established project with a mailing list<br />
        with 900+ subscribers. Mostly it&#8217;s all down to managing e-mail. When<br />
        someone writes feedback on the spec, whether by sending an e-mail to one<br />
        of the mailing lists I&#8217;m on, or by blogging somewhere, or twittering, I<br />
        log their feedback in a folder on my IMAP server. Feedback gets<br />
        categorised into either feedback I can work on right away, or feedback<br />
        that I can&#8217;t deal with yet for whatever reason. An example of the latter<br />
        would be requests relating to mutation events, because I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
        DOM3 Events to update how mutation events work. </p>
<p> Then, I just go through all the feedback I have, e-mail by e-mail, more or<br />
        less in the order that I received them, sending replies and fixing the<br />
        spec to address the issues that were raised.</p>
<p> This has some disadvantages, for example there&#8217;s a big delay in between<br />
        when someone spots an error and when I fix it. It also has some really<br />
        important advantages. If I respond to feedback on something I wrote<br />
        straight after writing it, I sometimes find that I have an attachment to<br />
        that section, so if someone suggests a total replacement, I tend to not<br />
        like their idea. But if I have a delay, I find my attachment has gone<br />
        away, and I&#8217;m eager to replace my old stupid idea with their better one.<br />
        (Assuming it&#8217;s better, anyway!) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Bruce</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the hardest thing to do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few things that are hard. One is saying &quot;no&quot; to people who have<br />
        clearly spent the time to come up with a good idea. The sad truth is that<br />
        I reject almost everything that I and anyone else thinks of, because if I<br />
        didn&#8217;t, the spec would be a thousand times more bloated than it is now. We<br />
        get proposals for all kinds of things, and we have to have a very high bar<br />
        for what goes in. There&#8217;s also the danger that if we add too many things<br />
        to the spec too quickly, the browser vendors will each implement their own<br />
        bit and it&#8217;ll be a big mess that won&#8217;t help Web authors. </p>
<p> So I have to make judgements about what is worth adding and what isn&#8217;t,<br />
        and that&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ve upset a lot of people by rejecting their ideas,<br />
        because they take it personally. On the other hand, some of the most<br />
        productive members of the community now are people who&#8217;ve had many of<br />
        their ideas rejected, but they stuck around long enough to see a few of<br />
        their ideas make it in. The best way to get an idea into the spec is to<br />
        find something in the spec that&#8217;s just clearly wrong, which is something<br />
        that a lot of the most active people do a lot, too!</p>
<p> Something else that&#8217;s hard is making up new features. The bulk of <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is<br />
        actually just defining how browsers already do things, which, although<br />
        complicated and sometimes unbelievably arcane, is, at the end of the day,<br />
        pretty easy to spec: you test the browsers, and you write what they do.<br />
        Rinse, repeat, until the spec covers every possible case.</p>
<p> Making up new features, though, means actually thinking about what should<br />
        happen, what is the most understandable solution, figuring out how things<br />
        should fit together, and so on. It&#8217;s often tempting to make something that<br />
        is theoretically neat, but which doesn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the<br />
        language, too. After all, that&#8217;s where all this came from&mdash;we don&#8217;t want<br />
        to create a new XForms, a really well-designed technology that doesn&#8217;t fit<br />
        into the way people write pages. </p>

Why  is it so important to do so, and isn&#8217;t it a lost cause given that those  techologies are already out there while <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is not yet complete?</p>

<p>HTML 4 is also in direct competition with proprietary technologies, and<br />
        it&#8217;s winning, hands-down. HTML5 is just continuing the battle, because if<br />
        we don&#8217;t keep up, then the proprietary technologies will gain ground.</p>

<p>What else did <abbr>WHATWG</abbr> try to achieve with this new iteration of <abbr>HTML</abbr>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started from trying to put features from XForms into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, and we<br />
        quickly also took the opportunity to fix some of the things in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 that<br />
        were either too vague or disagreed with reality (that is, where the<br />
        browsers all did one thing but the spec said another). It turns out that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is so vague that this is a pretty big task&mdash;it even involved<br />
        defining the whole <abbr>HTML</abbr> parsing model, including error handling, which is<br />
        a huge job (it took me the better part of a month to write the first<br />
        draft, and we were tweaking it for about a year before it become more or<br />
        less stable).</p>
<p>Something else we&#8217;ve tried to do is make things simpler. We&#8217;ve simplified<br />
        the syntax (e.g. the rules about what can be quoted, what strings are<br />
        valid <code>id</code>s, etc, are much simpler now). We&#8217;ve made things which people<br />
        used to do in JavaScript have shortcuts, so now you can just say <code>autofocus=&quot;&quot;</code> to focus a form field when the page loads, instead of using <code>control.focus()</code>, which allows the browser to do clever things like not<br />
        actually focus the control if the user is already typing elsewhere.</p>

<p><cite>Hixie:</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 actually makes the rules for markup even stricter than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 in<br />
        many ways, both for authors (the rules are simpler, but stricter, than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4&#8242;s) and for implementers (gone are the days where they can just do<br />
        whatever they want when handling parse errors, now every browser has to<br />
        act the same). </p>
<p> Hopefully, we&#8217;ve managed to make the rules on what is valid syntax more<br />
        understandable, which should help with getting more good markup. We&#8217;ve<br />
        also made it possible to write clearer validators, so I have high hopes.</p>

<p> Does including JavaScript and DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 spec dilute the<br />
        message about separating behaviour and structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know about a message about separating behaviour and structure, I<br />
        must have missed that memo! <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 takes a pretty hard line on separating<br />
        style and presentation from structure and semantics; there are no more <code>font</code> tags. Separating the logic and behaviour from the structure and<br />
        semantics of an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document isn&#8217;t as important, generally, as far as I<br />
        can tell. </p>
<p> The main advantage of defining the <abbr>HTML</abbr> DOM <abbr>API</abbr>s and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements in<br />
        the same specification is that we don&#8217;t let stuff fall through the cracks.<br />
        In practice, browsers implement the <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements as DOM nodes, there&#8217;s no<br />
        difference. When we separate the two in the specs, therefore, we introduce<br />
        a conceptual gap where there isn&#8217;t one in reality. The DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> spec, for<br />
        instance, doesn&#8217;t say what happens when you change the <code>type</code> attribute of<br />
        an <code>input</code> element <code>from</code> text  to <code>checkbox</code> on the fly, and the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4<br />
        spec doesn&#8217;t mention that changing attributes on the fly is possible, so<br />
        in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 / DOM2 <abbr>HTML</abbr> era, there&#8217;s a big hole there. In <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, this is<br />
        all defined together, so we can tighten this up and make sure there are no<br />
        gaps.</p>

<p>Why no native support for microformats/ <abbr>RDFa</abbr> in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5?</p>

<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microformats is natively supported in HTML5, just like it was in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,<br />
        because Microformats use the built-in extension mechanisms of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.</p>
<p>We considered RDFa long and hard (in fact this is an issue that&#8217;s a hot<br />
        topic right now), but at the end of the day, while some people really like<br />
        it, I don&#8217;t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of<br />
        authoring. For example, it uses namespaces and prefixes, which by and<br />
        large confuse authors to no end. Just recently though I proposed something<br />
        of a compromise which takes some of <abbr>RDFa</abbr>&#8216;s better ideas and puts them into <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused<br />
        people to invent <abbr>RDFa</abbr>. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>Do the browser makers have too much influence on the spec?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the browser vendors have the ultimate veto on<br />
        everything in the spec, since if they don&#8217;t implement it, the spec is<br />
        nothing but a work of fiction. So they have a lot of influence&mdash;I don&#8217;t<br />
        want to be writing fiction, I want to be writing a spec that documents the<br />
        actual behaviour of browsers. </p>
<p> Whether that&#8217;s too much, I don&#8217;t know. Does gravity have too much<br />
        influence on objects on earth? It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>

        therefore essential?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I would like Microsoft to get more involved with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. They&#8217;ve<br />
        sent very little feedback over the years, far less than the other browser<br />
        vendors. Even when asking them about their opinion on features they are<br />
        implementing I rarely get any feedback. It&#8217;s very sad. If I e-mail them a<br />
        question about how I can best help them, I usually get no reply; at best<br />
        I&#8217;ll get a promise that they&#8217;ll get back to me, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal access&mdash;the requirement that anyone be able to use information<br />
        on the Web&mdash;is a fundamental cornerstone of <abbr>HTML</abbr>&#8216;s design, just like<br />
        security, privacy, and so on. In general, we try to design features so<br />
        that they Just Work for everyone, regardless of how you are accessing the<br />
        Web. For example, in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 we&#8217;ve added new input controls like calendars.<br />
        These will Just Work with screen readers once browsers support them,<br />

<p>A couple did, but only to say they had little time for the standards<br />

<p>When there&#8217;s a built-in way to do something, using that is the simplest<br />

        without JavaScript, with or without a screen reader, and so on. ARIA is<br />
        useful when <abbr>HTML</abbr> doesn&#8217;t let you do what you want and you find yourself<br />
        hacking around with many nested <code>div</code>s, scripting your own controls and so<br />

<p>Yes, the plan is to make sure ARIA and HTML5 work well together. Right now<br />
        I&#8217;m waiting for ARIA to be complete (there are a number of last call<br />
        comments that they haven&#8217;t yet replied to), and for the ARIA<br />
        implementation rules to be clearer (it&#8217;s not yet obvious as I understand<br />
        it what should happen when ARIA says a checkbox is a radio button, for<br />
        instance). Once that is cleared up, I expect <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will give a list of<br />
        conformance criteria saying where ARIA attributes can be used and saying<br />
        how they should be implemented in browsers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is probably too early to start using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. </p>
<p> Long term, content authors will find a variety of new features in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5.<br />
        We have a bunch of new structural elements like <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>footer</code>, and so on. We have new elements for embedded media, like <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>. We have new input controls, like the calendars I mentioned,<br />
        but also fields for <abbr>URL</abbr>s, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and for<br />
        color selection. We have control over autocomplete values in text fields,<br />
        as well as field validation so that you can say which fields are required.<br />
        We have context menus, <code>pushState()</code> so you can update the <abbr>URL</abbr> in Ajax<br />
        applications, and offline application cache manifests so that your users<br />
        can take your applications offline. The list goes on.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s also the benefits that come from using an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 validator. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5<br />
        is much more precise about many things than <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, so the validators will<br />
        be more useful in catching real errors. The <code>embed</code> element is no longer<br />
        invalid.</p>

<p>Are there advantages for end-users, too? </p>

<p> Will there ever be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, or is it a convenient fiction to park<br />
        out-of-scope discussions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>Hixie</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be an <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6, and 7, and 8, and probably many more,<br />
        until someone comes up with something so radically better that we stop<br />
        evolving the Web as we know it. </p>
<p> I expect work on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 will start even before <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 is completely done, in<br />
        fact. Putting the finishing touches on <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 will be a long and tedious<br />
        job involving writing a massive test suite. <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 never had a serious test<br />
        suite created (it was too vague as a specification to really be properly<br />
        tested), so we have to start from scratch with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. The <abbr>HTML</abbr> 6 team will<br />
        at least be able to build on what we&#8217;ve done with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, I&#8217;m jealous!</p>
<p> Actually if it was up to me, after <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 I would probably transition <abbr>HTML</abbr> to an incremental model. Once we have a basic spec that is well-defined<br />
        and has been proven, instead of releasing a frozen snapshot every few<br />
        years, I&#8217;d prefer a model where we can slowly evolve the language, call it<br />
        &quot;<abbr>HTML</abbr> Current&quot; or something, without having to worry about versioning it.<br />
        To some extent that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, but I think formalising<br />
        it would really help.</p>
<p> Having versions of specs doesn&#8217;t make sense when you have multiple<br />
        implementations that are all evolving as well. No browser is ever going to<br />
        be exactly <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5, they&#8217;ll all be subsets or supersets. So why bother with<br />
        versioning the spec?</p>
<p> It&#8217;s a very unusual idea in the standards world, so I don&#8217;t expect us to<br />
        do this. But I do think it&#8217;d be the best way forward.</p>

												<p>I think if we&#8217;re talking about conflating structure and behaviour then surely we&#8217;re already in the realm of redefining what we mean by &#8220;Hyper-Text&#8221; and therefore should be defining the spec as something other than HTML? </p>
<p>The concept of paving the cow path is a most welcome one but perhaps we need to recognise that the cows have been trampling over the idea of a simple online document format for years now and signpost the paving with something that reaches beyond that idea. (While allowing for an underpass for the hedgehogs of simple semantics!)</p>

												<p><em>&#8220;If we don’t keep up, then the proprietary technologies will gain ground.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Try speaking without the label &#8220;proprietary&#8221;, and instead describe the specific outcomes you fear so much, that you will sacrifice HTML&#8217;s practicality in return.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that a variety of slowly-updated browser brands can realistically provide content creators and consumers with the same reliable functionality that a common cross-browser extension can. And yet there is talk of war, of fighting rather than cooperation. Something is wrong at a very deep level there.</p>
<p>I want to see Flash continue to provide all browsers with identical high-end functionality, uniting audiences for content developers, innovating fastest while enfranchising all browser choices. The browsers actually &#8220;gain ground&#8221; when Flash does.</p>

												<p>This is a very useful contextual insight into HTML5 and its progress. </p>
<p>Writing the spec for it must be a very energy consuming matter, so all respect to Hixie for working on it.</p>

												<p>@John Dowdell: I would say it&#8217;s one of the main problems with the web. Most clients/projects don&#8217;t see that one of the most interesting uses of Flash and HTML is exactly that: a mix of both, a hybrid thing (think Google Finance here, think EasyYouTube).</p>
<p>Using tools for what they&#8217;re good at and mixing them in the process is not that common. So at the end of the day people fight a fight of &#8220;I want HTML&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;no, I want Flash&#8221;. So HTMLers resolve to be radical and tell projects and clients that it&#8217;s either one or the other, because most of the time you eiher have a good Flash artist or a good HTML developer, but not both for budget questions etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, I&#8217;ll always find HTML more reliable than Flash. I don&#8217;t have a machine too powerful, or a big broadband connection. I *do* surf with Flash sometimes, never without HTML.</p>

												<p>@Phil Houghton: Actually the HTML5 spec was originally called &#8220;Web Applications 1.0&#8243; (you can see the remnants of this in the URL to the spec: <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/</a>). The name changed when the W3C changed their minds and asked us to work with them again.</p>

												<p>So that&#8217;s October this year. Maybe, perhaps, if the browser vendors are up to speed on it. So it might not be October then, HTML 6 possibly to start in development&#8230;</p>
<p>Good interview because I think it nicely clarifies HTML 5&#8242;s status at the moment.<br />
I liked the bit about &#8216;showModalDialog()&#8217; &#8211; that actually does sound good/useful.<br />
I also favour the &#8216;HTML Current&#8217; naming suggestion, versioning has always been a bit clunky for something as broadly-used as the Web (although that might not have been anticipated when first specs of HTML were originally being written of course!)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to October then! :)</p>

												<p>@John Dowdell: I fear what has already happened &#8212; lock-in to whichever vendors Adobe decides to support.

<p>You fear things which have not happened, and which (considering history of PostScript, PDF, and SWF) are not likely to happen. Such theoreticals are difficult for others to meaningfully address. </p>
<p>Like HTML, Flash Flex and AIR enfranchise Linux use. It&#8217;s not an iTunes &#8220;control&#8221; type of model. I&#8217;d urge you to reconsider your fears.</p>

												<p>Regarding RDFa: I agree on XML namespaces being confusing. They&#8217;ve been a source of endless problems in my experience. They&#8217;re one of the last things that turn XML from a human-readable language into something far more sinister.</p>

												<p>Proprietary technologies evolve fastest. They react to the market. They erupt forwards and improve things, in general.</p>
<p>After a while though, a proper, thought out, standards driven replacement can emerge. And it will be better than the rapidly developed, almost-designed, proprietary product it replaces.</p>
<p>Flash has served us well. And thanks for that. But the web will now evolve quicker with some parts replaced by HTML 5.</p>
<p>I suggest, John Dowdell, you start looking to the next thing that you can advance the web with.</p>

												<p>&gt; I think if we’re talking about conflating<br />
&gt; structure and behaviour</p>
<p>Structure and behavior is already conflated in HTML 4. You can separate them as much as you like in your own applications. HTML 5 is not forcing your hand either way.</p>
<p>&gt; [Flash]</p>
<p>I started working with Flash in 1997 and it frustrates me that things I could do then easily in Flash are still either hard to do or basically impossible on the Web.</p>
<p>However, Flash is not now and has never been part of the World Wide Web. The Web is an application of the Internet, same as Flash. They&#8217;re peers. The browser and Flash Player are 2 separate apps pretending to be one because Windows still doesn&#8217;t have its own MPEG-4 player.</p>
<p>WebKit is just a few megabytes, and it runs on Intel, PowerPC, and ARM with industry-leading performance. And it&#8217;s free and open source and used by Apple, Google, Nokia, Blackberry, Palm, and others. Mobiles have MPEG-4 decoder chips. There is no need for Flash on mobiles. If there was, it would already be there.</p>

												<p>Flash is a &#8220;common cross-browser extension&#8221;? Sure, a common, non-free implementantation (with variants and ports between browsers and platform).</p>
<p>If Gnash or other non-Flash flash implementations were to take off, we&#8217;d see the same slowdown as between browser implementors today.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have Flash installed. I will install a good HTML 5 implementation.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to lock my works in a platform that&#8217;s basically controlled by a single restricted-use, restricted-modification implementation. If Flash were DSFG-free, it&#8217;d be back in the running.</p>

												<p>The main thing that I miss about HTML5 is extensibility. Everything is either baked in and bloats the main spec or has to rely on clumsy, underspecified class-attribute hacks.</p>
<p>XML may not be perfect and the convention of using URLs as namespace identifiers must have created confusion without end. But at least XHTML has an extension mechanism &#8211; only that Microsoft never started supporting it. Why is there no consideration to do something similar with non-XML HTML5? Is using divs with strange attributes really better than using additional vocabularies in HTML? (RDFa is also a hack in this respect IMO, but at least it can accomodate extension vocabularies in a decentralized and conflict-free fashion. Before tossing that out of the window, an attempt should be made of doing namespaces in a clearer fashion, if URNs are considered to be too complicated).</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand this whole aspect of HTML5. Yes, the W3C XHTML stuff was over-engineered and sometimes far away from reality. Yes, they put the bar a bit too high and so the transition never happened. </p>
<p>But baking every possible use case into one core vocabulary won&#8217;t do either.</p>

												<p>I like the idea of non-version HTML standard. A lot of web apps doesn&#8217;t use versions anymore (they just simply update on the run).</p>
<p>However I&#8217;m scared about possible mess generated by various browsers and their implementation of the most recent rules &#8230; on the other hand it should be less work to do it step by step so they can better react &#8230; sounds interesting.</p>
<p>Looking forward for my first HTML 5 valid web page ;-)</p>

												<p>It is very important that the new standard and the team behind it (for example the Microsoft employee sitting on one of the chairs of the W3C) is able to connect browser vendors more and involve them that far, so web-developpers are not forced anymore to keep an eye on every single browser implementation. The success of the www is that all applications in it (talking about applications means even a simple html-only-page) are usable on so many diffenrent devices and operating systems. Eliminating differences between the browser implementations will speed up the evolution of the www.</p>
