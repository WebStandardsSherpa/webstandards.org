		<description>It is a great to hear that OWEA is working hard to help enhance and standardize the architecture of the World Wide Web. That will help to enhance the quality of education. This will lead to a huge improvement in solving the development issues world wide.</description>

		<description>Seeing as I am a connoisseur of the makings of the web, this has rubbed off on the kids as well. 

I&#039;m excited to see what this will provide to our school aged children, and, I&#039;m curious at what grade level will this be offered in the classroom.

I wonder how long it will take before GOOGLE sticks its head into the mix, or, maybe they will create their own web education incubator on their own. 

At any rate, I hope this moves along quickly. Thanks for the article.</description>
