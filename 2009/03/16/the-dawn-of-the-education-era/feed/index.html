		<description>Its great to see things like this coming about. Being a newcomer to the web design world and largly trying to learn it from home its great to see people taking the initiative to set some standards of education.
Well done.</description>

		<description>@Damon I hear you when you talk about the wasted time on an online college. But no program, online or offline, can actually rely on a good curriculum. The execution of that curriculum, the testing, and feedback mechanism is what makes a real course stand apart all the me-toos. This currculum is hence only a good first step. Many more are needed, and hopefully will follow.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m so happy to see something like this being done.  I&#039;m actually graduating this month from a popular online college, and it has been a complete waste of money.  The only good thing that will come from taking classes at this institution is the piece of paper that say&#039;s I have a degree.

The curriculum is narrow-minded, out of date, and too rudimentary for anyone to take into the workforce.  They don&#039;t teach the importance of validation (just to do it), they don&#039;t teach coding best practices, usability testing, or even accessibility basics. Luckily, sites like this one, A List Apart, and many others have intellectual &amp; insightful articles to help web designers.  To be truthful, I have learned more by reading the vast amount of blogs by the top web designers, than I have in 2 years of college.

Hopefully WaSP can help remedy this problem, because something drastic needs to change.</description>

		<description>The need to consider the web as an academic discipline has been long overdue. I explored the curriculum and found the Foundations section the most compelling. Isn&#039;t that what it is all about. I wish there was such a well thought out design when I was a lecturer of MIS at the Univ. of Texas at Austin. A recommendation would be to significantly expand the scope of the syllabus. I see the present one as a good starting point.</description>

		<description>I look forward to seeing this curriculum framework implemented at schools around the world.

Thank you to those who worked on the project.  I can&#039;t wait to help give back to it a bit.

		<description>Derek, Great to see you involved in this. I&#039;ve got some curriculum I&#039;ve been trying to figure out what to do with, and it seems like this is a good place to contribute it. And of course, I was hoping to find a place where educators would actually find it. Sounds like WaSP is that place.

I&#039;ll contact WaSP through the official form now.</description>
