		<description>Wouldn&#039;t it be lovely if Microsoft one day woke up and said: &quot;I can&#039;t be bothered with IE anymore, let&#039;s bundle Firefox in with Windows 7&quot;. Since that isn&#039;t going to happen, we&#039;ll have to carry on ranting and raving and hoping IE6&#039;s market share continues to plummet quickly, then IE7&#039;s, then IE8&#039;s and probably indefinitely hope the worst of the IE browsers vanish as quickly as possible.

That said, i&#039;d much rather develop for IE8 than IE7 or IE6 -- except for one thing -- every time I install IE8 I have to disable VISUAL STYLES on form elements: submit buttons are tiny! How could they release IE8 when something like this DOESN&#039;T WORK!? The average user is probably gonna mooch over to Google.com and search a few things here and there and rarely think about browser functionality. EXCEPT when they can&#039;t see their &#039;search&#039; and &#039;are you feeling lucky&#039; buttons! 

So, overall, &quot;IE8 is better, but still awry!&quot; I say. 

Hold on, anyone here got a horrible sense of déja vu?? I&#039;m guessing this was pretty much how IE7 was welcomed out. Same old same old with IE. 

Anyway, I live in hope:

&quot;The World Wide Web is broken for all IE users!&quot; 

&quot;Web developers have refused to develop for Internet Explorer. This means the vast majority of websites appear broken, in some cases illegible. It is recommended that users of the World Wide Web go to www.firefox.com and download the latest version of their browser.&quot;</description>

		<description>Unfortunately I have to support the browsers most used by our customer base, which is IE6 and IE7. Having said that, I have so many problems with positioning, padding, etc. 

I was really optimistic about the arrival of IE8 and the CSS compatibility but after a few days of testing I was disappointed to find that the new version had a laundry list of its own problems.

I will still do my best to develop and design for the new version but I can think of better things to do with my time rather than spend every moment creating special style sheets for the one browser that won&#039;t just jump on the compliance train with all the other happy passengers.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m currently using Firefox 3.0.8 and Google Chrome when using Windows XP, and just Firefox 3.0.6 on CentOS 5.3.
When I tried the 2nd beta version (for less than 10 minutes) of IE it was really slow loading, and it didn&#039;t always load the page, just complain that it had detected insecure browsing.
I&#039;m always checking the pages that produce output from PHP that I make with the HTML 4.01 Transitional doctype, so that I can ensure compatability for all browsers (Well... Most anyway...) but its really annoying that people use IE because it came with windows and they haven&#039;t ever thought about upgrading it or changing to a better one (probably Firefox or Google Chrome)
All I can say to people using IE is this:
Change to Google Chrome or Firefox or at least make sure you always use the latest version of IE.</description>

		<description>I prefer MF than IE. Always do. So I don&#039;t care about any improvements they made on IE8.</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t we just put IE to death and save the pain of it all.

It doesn&#039;t as was suggested &quot;For the first time, there is no need to have special CSS fixes for IE&quot;.

Here is a site I&#039;m working on http://handfoto.com/

It fully drops the background png in the menu bar and it makes the fades in Lightbox look like they came from the stone age.

It remains a plague on web design.</description>

		<description>I hav tried IE 8 and it has less problems like crashes then IE 7. Have also tried Chrome and Firefox 3. Really not impressed with any of them because none of them seem to work well with all sites. I really think their are too many (Standards) but not enough compliance. Seems to me like things are getting worse and not better.</description>

		<description>Judging by what I have heard so far about IE8, it&#039;s not that much significant improvement compared to what was expected at least. 

I still haven&#039;t installed it, although I am on Chrome and FireFox3 for a long time now. 

I suppose I will have to give a try soon, but the multiple IE testing is always a bit of a problem on the same machine anyway.

Standards compliance will ensure that sites will work nicely in IE8 as usual as with other browsers too.</description>
