		<description>I too would love to help with the &#039;gospel&#039; and fully agree that education through to enforcement is the real hurdle.

I actually just started at a utility company and am working with established employees to create / implement site and marketing standards that meet with current market standards. So I growing intimately familiar with this struggle, especially as many of the site management tools I have been encountering at times negate these very principles.</description>

		<description>I&#039;d definitely be interested in doing whatever I can.

I help organize London Web Standards (http://www.londonwebstandards.org), where some of the attendees might be able to offer even more help.

We&#039;d love to promote the curriculum and the Open Web Education Alliance, perhaps having a meeting entirely focused on the subject.</description>

		<description>A very wide scientific research program lead in France about nutrition should have better read your advices about browser standards compliance.

Unfortunately, the site is fully written with Adobe Flash, but even worse, it will only support Internet Explorer (on Windows only), Safari (on MacOSX only), and Firefox (on Windows or MacOSX), and refuse to run on more recent but still very valid modern browsers (despite they can fully support Adobe Flash).

So why using a proprietary GUI technology (Flash) if it does even worse than plain HTML/CSS, just to support a site that will only allow filling basic forms (select items in a list, enter a few free-form text if needed, then process to next screen, and a few presentation videos).

The study is very interesting du to its uncommon scale on scientific areas:
http://www.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/

Why did they not learn about current web standards? There was absolutely nothing requiring Flash, even for the most modest and antiquited browsers. But they refuse my installation of Chrome, or my alternate installation of Safari (on Windows) : you can&#039;t even subscribe if you don&#039;t have the correct browser. Also, despite I have Windows 7, I don&#039;t have Internet Explorer (and will never want it again).

Why should I use Firefox when I much prefer the much faster (and compliant) Chrome, which causes less hassle for its updates to maintain it secure, and does not need any of the poorly written plugins, and its horrible GUI that takes too much screen space?

You may need then to inform and train scientific research programs, so that they completely ban the services of those webdesigners that produced a so horrible site that does not work with all most famous current webbrowsers.</description>

		<description>We need more people involved in preserving basic standards.  I am always in favour of these types of activities because they only benefit people in the long-run.

The web sites I create use the most basic HTML with minimal CSS, and most of my sites actually work well in Netscape 5 as well as all the current web browsers, yet in the current web browsers they definitely look better and up-to-date.

Sadly, most web developers ignore this aspect of HTML coding.  Hopefully your efforts to preserve standards will make a bigger difference in the long run.</description>

		<description>Well these two goals are indeed vital to new developers and small businesses. I happen to be connected to both as I have a small family business and I&#039;m a new web developer myself. Of course I created my business website but when it comes to find some clients I do not have the power to compete against the sharks. I think the only way these days is get the necessary knowledge to become more or less an expert in a certain field..web development gets to be a burden at some point, I am a graphics artist, developer, marketer and security engineer at the same time..?!</description>

		<description>I&#039;m certainly interested. Not sure whether I can contribute something though as my knowledge is not as good as your guys knowledge.</description>

		<description>Please add me to your list of people getting involved in this. I stopped learning about the time AJAX was starting to come on the scene so I&#039;m really behind the times and I fall into that category of people that is currently upgrading my skill set. I&#039;m interested in the interview questions, especially, as a guideline to be able to compete in the workforce. Good stuff here, glad you guys are still around.</description>

		<description>As the owner of a small development company that is always trying to figure out the best development strategies, a place to find best practices is enormously beneficial.  I am not sure how I can help, but always open information which will help my companies success.  Best of luck to any small business, it is never an easy road for us.</description>
