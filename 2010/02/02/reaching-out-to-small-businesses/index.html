			</div>

			<p>A lot of you are probably wondering where the WaSP of the late ’90s or even the early ’00s has gone. Where are the actions? Where is the advocacy? Who should we be mad at today?</p>
<p>The truth is that this organization is evolving. For the last two years, a large amount of our focus has been placed on education, realized in our creation of <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/index.html">the InterAct curriculum framework</a> and the birth of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/owea/">Open Web Education Alliance</a>. With the lion&#8217;s share of our talent and energy devoted to these efforts, things have been noticeably quiet on this blog, but that&#8217;s not an excuse&#8230;we can and should be doing more to promote the understanding and use of web standards. After all that&#8217;s what we were formed to do.</p>
<p>For the last two or three years, WaSP&#8217;s relevance has definitely diminished. With a few exceptions, browsers are doing a darn good job of promoting standards. Techniques we championed, such as Unobtrusive JavaScript and Progressive Enhancement, have become engrained in the methodology of many great web agencies and in-house web teams. In many ways, it seems WaSP has won the war for web standards, but has it really? There are still a ton of small web companies and small to mid-sized businesses building websites with little or no regard for cross-browser /cross-device compatibility. Inaccessible sites and applications, especially in this age of Ajax, seem to pop up every few seconds.</p>
<p>These projects have been put together by web designers and developers we&#8217;ve never reached and, for the last few years, we&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to change that. Sure, our education effort is a logical means of teaching the next generation of web designers and developers to do things the Right Way™, but what of the practicing professionals who either have not been exposed to web standards or have been reluctant to upgrade their skill set? How do we reach them?</p>
<p>One way we hope to move this group in the right direction is by doing an end-run around them in reaching out to small businesses.</p>
<p>Small businesses drive our national economies and are responsible for millions of websites worldwide. Of course, most small businesses don&#8217;t know (or even want to know) about the technical aspects of web standards, but they do want to know what will save them money and help them run their businesses more efficiently.</p>
<p>As the first project in our small business outreach effort, WaSP will be developing a resource to be used when interviewing individuals and teams to do web work. The focus of this effort will be a series of questions that, when asked of applicants, will help a small business determine whether or not they have the skills necessary to build a modern website. Each question be coupled with background on the associated topic that outlines why it is important and tips for determining how well the question was answered.</p>
<p>Our goals for this project are two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>To support small businesses by protecting them from bad developers and making sure they get the best websites possible; and</li>
<li>To expose individual designers and small web shops to web standards when they go out to bid on projects in hopes that they will choose to upgrading their skills in order to continue getting work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to make this project a success, we need your help. Whether you are interested in helping us collect and organize the content or are keen to promote the resource once it&#8217;s complete, we want you to be involved. If you can lend a hand, please say so in a comment on this message and I will be in touch at the beginning of next week.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;d be happy to help in any way you guys see fit. Adoption of Web Standards was the one of the primary reasons I&#8217;ve been able to continue to happily stay in design/development for years now. I&#8217;d love to give back in any way I can.</p>

												<p>I wish you luck, it&#8217;s been too quiet on here and yet it&#8217;s still a valuable need in our community, especially the designers moving up!</p>
<p>In regards to small businesses (I have many vendors I work with in Property Management), I&#8217;d love to see a membership or rule of standards such as AIGA <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/standards-professional-practice" rel="nofollow">http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/standards-professional-practice</a>. </p>
<p>Although some of us are AIGA members, it really doesn&#8217;t associate itself as a web industry, and their technology is often still of the mentality towards &#8216;flash&#8217; and code-is-not-design (wrongly so I&#8217;d say). I&#8217;d love to see an associate more modern I can wear with a badge of respect; much like when I handle the Architects we hire for our build outs, who hold LEED certification. I don&#8217;t expect them to be LEED geniuses, but I expect them to have a focus on the green industry, and take it seriously. </p>
<p>I will say that more and more, the issue I have are websites and developers/designers teaching standards and publicly ignoring things such as validation, accessibility, and in some cases openly bashing it. In my small nook of designers I manage for my team at <a href="http://bentlyholdings.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bentlyholdings.com</a> &amp; <a href="http://bentlyreserve.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bentlyreserve.com</a>, atleast monthly I&#8217;m shown a website or a tutorial site with a professional is bombing said techniques. It seems odd to still have these arguments now a days, but they come up often&#8230; unfortunately, I know now solution save debating with them. </p>
<p>So if you need the help, I&#8217;d love to help! One thing I was already planning is a huge tech event at our bentlyreserve.com &#8211; the focus was to bring in not only our tenants, but our vendors and their vendors, and associates for a few days. Merge the worlds of technology and design, teach, network, and do more. If this is something you&#8217;d like to join us for in San Francisco, we were planning on June, and I&#8217;d welcome any of your staff! As a trade off, you&#8217;d get to meet high tech folks from MS to Google on the IT spectrum of things; both of these worlds would do a great good to collaborate more, they are gatekeepers.</p>

												<p>I would certainly be interested in helping out &#8211; although I&#8217;m not sure how much help I&#8217;d be, I only started out quite recently.</p>
<p>However, I have been thinking a lot about how people could tell if their website has been poorly made. I thought maybe some sort of automated validator that tests for nested tables, lack of css, inline HTML, and errors on the HTML validator &#8211; but I suspect there&#8217;d be too many false positives and not enough hits.</p>
<p>I would certainly be keen to help promote the scheme once it&#8217;s finished though. I&#8217;m part of a network in Sheffield that&#8217;s designed to get newly formed businesses in contact and it would be great if there were some way to let them know how to find a good wed-designer.</p>

												<p>Hello. I&#8217;m a mid-life career change student currently studying HTML, XHTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, AJAX and MySQL along with design and UI concepts. I am very interested in the Small Business Outreach effort that you are developing. My interest is driven by the desire to provide myself with the highest level of education and to eventually provide a line of quality products with strong foundations in standards. As your article states this project will help developers and designers target areas where they are weak. Those that are willing to look at their own practices will not only to survive<br />
today&#8217;s market but will thrive in the future. </p>
<p>During the course of my studies, I have considered questions that may be directed my way, in order to determine the level of quality I can provide as a website developer and designer. As those thoughts have only been passive, I have yet to compile a list of these questions. However, I would be willing to share my thoughts if it would help. I would also be very interested in reviewing questions as the project is developed. I have a strong background in customer satisfaction and project management as a Business Systems Analyst. My background may be useful in the review process of the questions as I am very aware that questions asked can easily direct the answer and skew data.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time<br />
Phillip Ballew Sr.</p>

												<p>Well these two goals are indeed vital to new developers and small businesses. I happen to be connected to both as I have a small family business and I&#8217;m a new web developer myself. Of course I created my business website but when it comes to find some clients I do not have the power to compete against the sharks. I think the only way these days is get the necessary knowledge to become more or less an expert in a certain field..web development gets to be a burden at some point, I am a graphics artist, developer, marketer and security engineer at the same time..?!</p>

												<p>We need more people involved in preserving basic standards.  I am always in favour of these types of activities because they only benefit people in the long-run.</p>
<p>The web sites I create use the most basic HTML with minimal CSS, and most of my sites actually work well in Netscape 5 as well as all the current web browsers, yet in the current web browsers they definitely look better and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Sadly, most web developers ignore this aspect of HTML coding.  Hopefully your efforts to preserve standards will make a bigger difference in the long run.</p>

												<p>A very wide scientific research program lead in France about nutrition should have better read your advices about browser standards compliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the site is fully written with Adobe Flash, but even worse, it will only support Internet Explorer (on Windows only), Safari (on MacOSX only), and Firefox (on Windows or MacOSX), and refuse to run on more recent but still very valid modern browsers (despite they can fully support Adobe Flash).</p>
<p>So why using a proprietary GUI technology (Flash) if it does even worse than plain HTML/CSS, just to support a site that will only allow filling basic forms (select items in a list, enter a few free-form text if needed, then process to next screen, and a few presentation videos).</p>
<p>The study is very interesting du to its uncommon scale on scientific areas:<br />
<a href="http://www.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/</a></p>
<p>Why did they not learn about current web standards? There was absolutely nothing requiring Flash, even for the most modest and antiquited browsers. But they refuse my installation of Chrome, or my alternate installation of Safari (on Windows) : you can&#8217;t even subscribe if you don&#8217;t have the correct browser. Also, despite I have Windows 7, I don&#8217;t have Internet Explorer (and will never want it again).</p>
<p>Why should I use Firefox when I much prefer the much faster (and compliant) Chrome, which causes less hassle for its updates to maintain it secure, and does not need any of the poorly written plugins, and its horrible GUI that takes too much screen space?</p>
<p>You may need then to inform and train scientific research programs, so that they completely ban the services of those webdesigners that produced a so horrible site that does not work with all most famous current webbrowsers.</p>

												<p>I too would love to help with the &#8216;gospel&#8217; and fully agree that education through to enforcement is the real hurdle.</p>
<p>I actually just started at a utility company and am working with established employees to create / implement site and marketing standards that meet with current market standards. So I growing intimately familiar with this struggle, especially as many of the site management tools I have been encountering at times negate these very principles.</p>
