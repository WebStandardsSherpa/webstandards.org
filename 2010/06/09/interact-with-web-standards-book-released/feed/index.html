		<description>It is very important for people to give back to the community when they are in a position to do so. InterAct is doing a great job of driving responsible use of the Web and this new book has a lot of value to add. The fact that this book covers a whole range of topics and that the authors have the relevant experience, makes this a must buy. Thank you for the information and the links to relevant pages.</description>

		<description>Thank you for the valuable information. This book will be very helpful to people like myself that is self taught and that needs guidance. This book is worth buying and knowing that a portion of the proceeds are donated to education makes it even more so.</description>
