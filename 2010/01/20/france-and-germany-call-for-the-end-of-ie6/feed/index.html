		<description>I think this won&#039;t have any impact on the use of IE6 in France &amp; Germany. It is Microsoft by themself, because of Windows 7. The other way to stop the IE6 is getting support by Google ( because of Google Chrome ) for example.

The IE6 seems to be a tought adversary ;o)</description>

		<description>I dont think that a warning from the gouverment has any effect.
As long as most people have Windows they will use IE.</description>

		<description>Whilst everyone is correct that the real issue here is corporate use (IE6 being a common company network browser and the max upgrade on Windows 2000 - still arguably the most popular platform for corporate networks, remember how long NT5 stuck around!!!) I remain confused why just France and Germany are getting involved. Furthermore, why are their Governments leading the charge, surely they have better things to be doing in these times!!!!</description>

		<description>No one is listening to the gouverment on technical topics. And thats good. Not long ago german gov warned of using the internet at all. Especially für banking und business communication.</description>

		<description>This definitely has implications in Germany and increasing the use of alternatives such as Firefox steadily. And the rejection by the world go on IE6, I&#039;m sure.</description>

		<description>Well, it should. But it won’t. We will have to cope with IE6 for quite some time. The way the majority sees and perceives the web will prevent a change in the near future</description>

		<description>Hi all,

to question 1: I think the same, Internet Explorer 6 have a lot of security vulnerabilities. And many peaple now in Germany are using Google Chrome because it´s faster and have not so many &quot;Security vulnerabilities&quot; as Internet Explorer 6. I mean that´s right what France and Germany doing. 

And one Question: Can I explain this article in German to share on my website? I think it´s an interesting article for some peaple.

Many Regards from Germany,
