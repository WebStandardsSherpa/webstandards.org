		<description>We are looking at doing the same for our car dealers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgoodcars.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Just Good Cars&lt;/a&gt;. We Just need to make sure that the system is idiot proof first and then the dealers will be able to also use the page as their own homepage. The css can make it look like their own personal site.</description>

		<description>8000 characters of custom css is more than enough i think because its &quot;only&quot; an astore and not a hole big webpage. the move from amazone is okay in my opinion because everybody want a little bit &quot;unique&quot; even if its just an astore. just have a look what the future will bring.</description>

		<description>It is an interesting experiment and could lead to better use of the web. There are probably very few people who would be prepared to customise their own stylesheets so ultimately usage depends on how easy and obvious these sort of things will develop into.
