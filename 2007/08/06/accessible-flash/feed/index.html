		<description>Flash has been well and was also used frequently, in spite of the problems with browser plugin and firewall settings. The main problems are search engine. Today every Webmaster is trying his side for search engine optimization, and flash is not a good option.</description>

		<description>Flash is a great alternative to multimedia......alpha channel video, online video editing, online drawing applications, multi-user games</description>

		<description>I know that search engines are more and more capable to read flash. If i remember google has been reading flash a while back ago. What I as a user, surfing the internet and website owner find difficult is that most flash website dont navigate easily or properly or people dont have any plugs available so they cant view the flash.</description>

		<description>I am upset that in 10 years time there STILL haven&#039;t been any options for embedding sound and video files (in a way that is consistent) except for Flash.  

Maybe there&#039;s some way it can be done in Java, but I don&#039;t want to talk about my beef with Java here--this is a discussion about Flash.  I think browser plugins as a &quot;standard&quot; to handle audio and video is NOT the way to go.  I think it&#039;s tragic that so many places like YouTube have been forced to use Flash because of the lack of real web standards that have barely moved forward in 10 years.  If there were standards for doing this, I&#039;m sure that the web would be filled with a lot more audio and video clips, and yes, it would be filled with a lot of amateur pages that have really bad coding and lots of cut and pasted coding--people have to learn to make pages somehow, and that&#039;s the way most people learn.

I have a real hard time supporting a standard that makes it possible to turn a webpage into a kiosk.  

It doesn&#039;t mean that everyone using Flash HAS to make it so if you use the right mouse button on their page that you only get to see Flash options and no options that let you see the raw code. :rolleyes:  Okay, that was a lame attempt at sarcasm, but you get what I&#039;m saying.

That&#039;s really my biggest problem with Flash.  I learn by example, and with Flash I don&#039;t have that option.  Yes yes, I know there are tutorials, but most of them are worded in a way that my ADHD disallows me to learn with--where I get to read 20 pages of how to do things I&#039;m not interested in and 1/20 of a page on the things I am interested in.  I need direct examples that I can modify and ask &quot;let&#039;s see what THIS does when I change THIS in this document&quot;.  In Flash, the only things I can do that in are FLA files that people are offering for free, which usually don&#039;t amount to much--I can never find any that do things I&#039;m interested in doing.

If I had the money, I&#039;m sure I could take some classes on flash, and I might even be able to afford buying it instead of reinstalling the demo every 30 days.

I think it&#039;s a bad idea to make doing something like playing an mp3 something that takes 5 pages of code to write in flash action script OR be forced to use someone else&#039;s SWF that has their logo on it that can&#039;t be removed or works like crap because it&#039;s the free version.  

Being able to do that kind of thing in HTML is LONG overdue!  We should be upset at the pathetic state of web standards, not at Flash, because if web standards improved, NOBODY would ever &quot;need&quot; to use Flash.  It would be a preference instead of a necessity.</description>

		<description>Among Flash&#039;s greatest strengths, we&#039;ve seen that it offers users the ability to view all of the steps in the process in one visual display. Flash also enables users to attack the application steps in their own order.</description>

		<description>Google can’t index Flash pages precisely because it is not a proper standard. It can’t look inside Flash objects. Even if Google bought a Flash reader from Adobe, there are endless lists of applications that can’t access Flash content.</description>
