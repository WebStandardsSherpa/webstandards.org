		<description>I went down to the iPhone launch today, down on Regent Street in London. Would there be a queue snaking round the block? Would there be thousands of people clamouring to get in? Um, no. Check out the video of the guy in the front of the queue, as of midday today. And for added fun, click over the jump and check out the guy who was at the front of the queue at the New York launch</description>

		<description>I mthink alot of designers should r4alize that there ae more blackberry users than iPhone users but the problem is the blackberry users don&#039;t check out sites to much. I think RIm will be pushing the design of the blackberry even more in the future so by combining iPhone concerns and blackberry issues you have a huge user base.</description>

		<description>all those sites with iPhone portals are not designed using any proprietary technology, but instead are built on top of web standards with some of the elements assigned with unique attribute for supporting Google Maps, contacts info…

the CSS property that starts with -webkit- are just there for time being to provide support of some CSS3 properties. Designer can simply add corresponding CSS3 properties, and everything will work in other browsers that supports those properties. So the design is not locked in.

So how could this be cooked up as IE4 all over again. This is not even remotely close to that kind of history deliberately created by Microsoft.</description>

		<description>I also bought the IPhone and like the Safari browser.

&quot;While mobile Safari performs brilliantly when it comes to CSS rendering, it does have a few problems.&quot;

That&#039;s the problem - and I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t fixed it. By testing the phone you normally see the problem. Maybe a bugfix will be available soon :)</description>

		<description>[...] I was in discussion with a friend during the after-soccer-let&#8217;s-eat-drink-talk-and-look-at-chics session that I am anticipating more iPhone-like devices to be surging in the market in the next five years or so; which in turn could redefine Internet usage by consumers. I opined that it would be a clever decision to also develop websites to be &#8220;mobile-device friendly&#8221;. We could start off with the freely available Opera Mini as a testbed for web contents and presentational medium and not tarry too much with iPhone&#8217;s Safari yet. [...]</description>

		<description>youssef spencer:
&quot;what do you mean that the iphone isnt good and all that crap do you even have it ?&quot;

It is widely regarded as a splendid idea to read an article before you comment on it, as opposed to after. Which, if you truly believe it says the iPhone isn&#039;t good, you probably haven&#039;t.

Feel free to return with your insightful comments once you have grasped what the article is actually about.

Thank you, and have a nice day.</description>
