		<description>I fully support web accessibility however, a technology to vary font size via the user&#039;s monitor seems like an easier solution.  It is difficult to respond to every form of visual disability via website design.</description>

		<description>So did anyone manage to get some coverage from the talk? I just red the post and the worst thing is that I was on London that day so could have made it if I knew in advance. Oh well...</description>

		<description>recently my friend bought a cd player from the rnib, the cd&#039;s that were sent with it were not in braille nor the actual cd player buttons or controls. 
Another thing that I find shocking is the price difference between an ordinary computer for a blind person. 

They need to improve some of there standards themselves,
