		<description>I was referring to the whole thing (including the black) as the &quot;blurb&quot;.  So there&#039;s 11.  And regardless, the link to the story (the most likely destination of a person visiting this page) is one of the least prominent elements on the page.  Again, poor choice.  

I wonder if I can coin a term here.  Link roulette?  Link madness?  Red herring links?</description>

		<description>So it appears like they are having second thoughts about the idiotic &quot;baseline&quot; system, which should be interesting.</description>

		<description>Someone has to come up with a name for this kind of thing.  A blurb talking about an interview, 11 LINKS in the blurb, and only ONE, mid-sentence, links directly to the thing you&#039;re talking about.  For a standards group, you rate pretty low on usability.</description>

		<description>I am remaining optimistic that the WCAG 2 will be &quot;right&quot; at the time it&#039;s released. They are asking for everone&#039;s insight, so as long as we keep mentioning issues that are relevant to us, let&#039;s hope 90% gets acted upon. Hey, at least they haven&#039;t given up.</description>

		<description>I think one of the main things I appreciated about the interview was the fact that the WCAG 2 guidelines will be alot more understandable and there will be enhanced support material that comes with it.</description>

		<description>I found this interview interesting. Judy Brewer claims that they have listened to the criticism they got and made significant alterations to WCAG 2.0. When the next version is revealed we will know if it is true. Until then it is premature to judge the working group.</description>

		<description>In what respect were those questions “probing”? They were mostly restatements of “Your process really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; so strong it will nullify all the objections to WCAG 2, isn’t it?”</description>
