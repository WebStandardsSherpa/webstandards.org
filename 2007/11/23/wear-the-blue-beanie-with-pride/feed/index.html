		<description>It was a really happy blue beanie Day! However,  no one knew, what going on with blue beanie on my head! I believe this idea is not popular in Poland… as much as I thought.</description>

		<description>as much as i respect mr Zeldman I feel that this kind of thing is more about who Talks about web standards than who actually cares - give out blue beanies once some of the cretins still using tables have passed a basic css course and maybe wearing one on a particular day will have some weight (other than trying desperately to fit into yet another community).</description>

		<description>The &quot;Operation Firefox&quot; is grandious, but wearing a blue beanie says nothing about anything. But, by the way a blue beanie makes a better-looking person out of you. I like to be an agent, not a guy wearing a blue hat.</description>
