Mind you, Bruce, didn&#039;t they originally claim the DTI web site was &#039;AA&#039; compliant ?!</description>

		<description>Not sticking up for them, but it&#039;s perhaps worth noting that the UK government has a standard called e-GIF for all their suppliers and internal projects that requires (among various other things like XML metadata) the use of published W3C standards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the highest level, complying with e-GIF means: 
 
• providing a browser interface for access  
• using XML as the primary means for data integration 
• using Internet and World Wide Web standards  
• using metadata for content management. — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/schemasstandards/egif_document.asp?docnum=949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;e-Government Interoperability Framework Version 6.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So the petition should really be calling for this to be enforced and implemented across all web-based services.</description>
