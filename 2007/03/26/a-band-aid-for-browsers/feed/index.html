		<description>Hello  Rafael, I think  Ajax is actually a family of technologies that have been available for years. The means to make requests to the server using only JavaScript were built into Internet Explorer 5.5, but the possibilities of the technology were overlooked. The techniques were rediscovered and used, notably to excellent effect…

This means that when you send a request, you wait for the response to come back, but are free to do other things while you wait. The response probably won’t come back immediately, so you set up a function that will wait for the response to be sent back by the server, and react to it once that happens.

JavaScript is used to make a request to the server. Once the response is returned by the server, you will generally use some more JavaScript to modify the current page’s document object model in some way to show the user that the submission went through successfully. 

The data that you receive back from the server will often be packaged up as a snippet of XML, so that it can be easily processed with JavaScript. This data can be anything you want, and as long as you want. 

There’s nothing really new about what is happening here. We’re requesting a file (which will often be a server-side script, coded in something like PHP), and receiving a page as the response. This is how the web works already — the only difference is that now we can make these requests from JavaScript.</description>

		<description>Javascript respectively Ajax is an absolute must for the Next-Generation Web Application Development. Anyone should thus enable Javascript. That&#039;s my opinion!</description>

		<description>I agree with Andy, but there is a development to web 2.0 standard. Java is a simple way to solve problems to build websites.</description>

		<description>Hallo Mr.Koops... I’ve run into the same thing with marketing agencies who provide web design services. Most I’ve seen tend to concern themselves with how quickly a job can be done and less with the quality of the site altogether, whether in the design or in the code. Many business, whether on the client side or the provider side have a lot to think about when running a business. What I try to get across when talking to people about standards is that it’s really so much simpler than they think, and it can even be much faster than they imagine in the long run to put out the mumbled up messes they were putting out pre-standards.</description>

		<description>This is an interesting discussion. I&#039;m a big friend of &quot;In a nutshell, make it small, flexible and standards-based.&quot; We have always problems to create an consistent code for all browsers. Where ist the next Band-Aid for browsers?</description>

		<description>OK, it depends on the browsers version? 
But I use the famous browser Opera. 
How do you think of using this browser. 
Is there the same problem. Till now I 
think Opera is the best browser to test
websites.</description>

		<description>Also I rank myself among this majority. My interest lies not in the handling of a Programiersprache separates in the ability to learn of a technology for the publication of contents on my Website. With HTML4 I can begin already very much. But I am grateful and content.</description>
