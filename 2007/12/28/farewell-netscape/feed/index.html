		<description>The closure of support for Netscape was a really negative surprise. I didn&#039;t understand why this had to happen after Netscape had started off with a completely revised and easy-to-use interface in the version 9. Hey - the browser wasn&#039;t even given the time to get known among the old Netscape users, of whom there are tens of millions (if not hundreds). That just wasn&#039;t an honest test! The dumbest thing about it all was the lack of advertisement for Netscape by AOL, even on its own sites - I mean, why pay almost ten billion for a company and then do nothing for the acquisition? Just doesn&#039;t make economic sense!

Well, I&#039;ve been using Netscape since early 1998 and I&#039;ll continue using version 9.0.0.5 in the near future (It usually takes something like two to three years before a browser starts developing insufficiency problems). Still got to try out the e-mail suite, but at the moment the 7.1 client is sufficient.

I do hope somebody with the necessary intelligence and finances takes over the brand and restarts it under more favourable circumstances than NS got from AOL! I mean - the name is a household word in the Internet!

Some years ago I owned an Internet cafe here in Germany with 24 PCs for visitors - Netscape 4.78 was the last standard browser we used. Sometime we were forced to uninstall Outlook from all systems because of the increasing number of virus infections caused by careless e-mail users.

		<description>Wow I don&#039;t remember seeing to many reviews about software that compare the experience to a mortal passing. But beyond that fact the netscape demise just shows what happens when corporate companies try to wrestle with independent internet business models. It been over for Netscape for sometime but now its official.</description>

		<description>I am curious whether there again in a few years looks different. Nobody knows how the Internet will develop. Netscape is certainly in the next few years to come, the only question is how!</description>

		<description>I do agree with Ian&#039;s article. Netscape had his importance, but management obviously made many wrong decisions. A good indication for this is offered by the Alexa Tool. Looking at the traffic details, you can see that currently around 0,06 % of the Alexa user visit Netscape.com every day versus nearly 1 % in the years 2002 and 2003. So the website was amongs the 200 most visited websites in the www:

As Google  has showed us impressively, a good product will automaticly find more users. Netscape already hat the users, but they did not recommend the browser to their friends, while Google users recommended search and nowadays maps, news, finance to their friends.

The world is moving forward and obviously Netscape has moved and improved too slowly ...</description>

		<description>@faruk and Alex:
I can understand your feelings an all. But please remember. If &quot;Mozilla&quot; had not been rewritten from scratch, web standards probalby weren&#039;t where they are now today.

Sadly, NS 4 made IE 5 to implement the CSS Box model wrong, which is just awful...

Anyway. Could you guys &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt; chat with Netscape again? The german portal (netscape.de) still offers NS7.1 which is &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;unsupported&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is AOL still doing this? It&#039;s annoying to have this old browser on the market. They should recommend Firefox there as well!</description>
