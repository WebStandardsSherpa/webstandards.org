			<p><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> Chief Technology Officer and co-inventor of CSS, <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome">Håkon Wium Lie</a> has written  an <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2007/msft/">open letter to the Web community</a> explaining the reasons that Opera has filed an <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/">antitrust complaint with the European Union</a> to force Microsoft to support open Web standards in Internet Explorer and to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows and/or carry alternative browsers pre-installed on the desktop.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/">press release</a> says</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/"><p>
Opera requests the Commission to implement two remedies to Microsoft’s abusive actions. First, it requests the Commission to obligate Microsoft to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows and/or carry alternative browsers pre-installed on the desktop. Second, it asks the European Commission to require Microsoft to follow fundamental and open Web standards accepted by the Web-authoring communities. The complaint calls on Microsoft to adhere to its own public pronouncements to support these standards, instead of stifling them with its notorious &#8220;Embrace, Extend and Extinguish&#8221; strategy. Microsoft&#8217;s unilateral control over standards in some markets creates a de facto standard that is more costly to support, harder to maintain, and technologically inferior and that can even expose users to security risks.

												<p>I applaud Opera for taking on Microsoft. Its about time. The European Court of First Instance confirmed in September that Microsoft has illegally tied Windows Media Player to Windows. Opera has long held the position of innovator in the Web browser market, having introduced and pioneered features like tabbed browsing, Speed Dial, integrated search bar, mouse gestures.</p>

												<p>I don&#8217;t see the legality of suing MS over web standards. The W3C isn&#8217;t the law. I do however understand their resoning for suing because IE comes installed on Windows. MS will have a difficult time now that IE7 isn&#8217;t embedded into Windows like IE6 was. </p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t OSX come installed with Safari and numerous other software?</p>
<p>Linux comes pre-installed with software too. Hmm&#8230;..</p>

												<p>They&#8217;re not suing, they&#8217;re filing a complaint &#8211; don&#8217;t ask me the legal details, but there is a difference!</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not so much that MS isn&#8217;t allowing anyone to install alternate browsers, but that they&#8217;re using that in-built market share to make standards-compliant browsers less attractive to users, (the old &#8216;IE has the largest marketshare, we have to develop for it first, the others get a look-in if we have the time and money&#8217; problem).</p>
<p>Linux and OSX provide browsers that are standards-compliant and not holding back the progress of the web.</p>

												<p>Interesting to note that Firefox has enjoyed increasing market share despite Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;abusive actions&#8221; and &#8220;stifling&#8221; of standards.  Opera needs to take a page out of Firefox&#8217;s book, not whine about Microsoft.</p>

												<p>Hello W3C web standards colleagues and friends,</p>
<p>I have sent an email to Håkon Wium Lie giving my full and unconditional support to his official compliant . Yes, Microsoft should be forced to support open W3C Web standards in Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer should be unbundlable from Windows.</p>
<p>I think webstandards.org and web standards promoters, supporters should all do the same. </p>
<p>We should all be united behind this complaint.</p>

												<p>hoopskier, sure FF has done a good job of leveraging their advantages and their community. But how much faster would FF have caught on in the early days if IE had been progressive about the standards that Mozilla insisted on? How many more corporate sites would be using FF now, instead of standardising on IE? Mozilla stands to gain as much, if not more, from this than Opera.</p>

												<p>&#8220;Interesting to note that Firefox has enjoyed increasing market share despite Microsoft’s “abusive actions” and “stifling” of standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>MSIE still commands more than 80% of the browser market, and that is after billions of dollars and many years have been spent on trying to make a dent. Microsoft&#8217;s behavior has cost everyone big money, including alternative browser vendors and web developers.</p>
<p>That MSIE still has nearly 90% of the market tells you that things are still broken.</p>

												<p>&#8220;But how much faster would FF have caught on in the early days if IE had been progressive about the standards that Mozilla insisted on?&#8221;</p>
<p>If MS would have had better standards support all along&#8230; then there&#8217;d be less people using Firefox.  Poor standards support is a reason that many people (especially web developers) use Firefox instead of IE.  Take away that, and there&#8217;s less reason to use Firefox.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about the bundling issue (take a look at the virtually zero sales of the Media Player-less &#8220;N&#8221; editions), the government is in no place to &#8220;force&#8221; a company to follow a standard that was largely written by a set of competitors.  Government-written standards (like safety regulations for cars) are a totally different story.</p>
<p>So, who decides which standards are important enough?  Do they have to be &#8220;final&#8221;, which even CSS 2.1 isn&#8217;t?  This would set a terrible precedent not just for the technology industry, but in other industries as well.  Name me *one* other industry wherein a private non-government group can write a recommendation, and where the government legally forces the market leader to follow those recommendations.</p>

												<p>Filing a complaint about bundeling IE6 with Windowsas , compared with Windows Media Player is something I can understand from a competitive point of view.</p>
<p>However, complaining that Microsoft is not supporting standards the right way is rather strange, since there is no actual law implementing those standards and making it compulsory.</p>
<p>Within Europe there isn&#8217;t even one standard for electrical plugs and sockets. The question is if the Internet should be regulated, including the adherence to any standard. I, for one, would rather see no law than a &#8216;standards&#8217; law, because once we allow that the Internet will be broken apart within years by different lawmaking institutions in different countries. The freedom of the Internet makes it even hard for countries that DO have laws for the Internet to regulate it properly (think fo China for instance).</p>
<p>From a competitive viewpoint it is more interesting to see if a free version of a browser, tied to a specific operating systems is indeed &#8216;free&#8217; and not an effective barrier for entrance to other browser vendors, as a company or a consumer I do not have the freedom to buy Windows without IE and pay less for it (nor do I have that freedom with Mac OSX for that matter).</p>
<p>IF anyone has to call upon Microsoft it should be its clients, big corporations and banks who should tell Microsoft to get their act together and support the W3C standards immediatly or face the end of multi-million contracts, because they are fed up with spending so much money on keeping their websites and transaction software working on a zillion different versions of HTML and not being able to move forward to smatter and cheaper solutions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I respect Opera a lot for what they have done &#8212; what if the EU decides that standards should be made legal?</p>

												<p>&#8220;Will Opera and Microsoft be able to work together on the W3C despite this legal spat. I would expect so. This almost the same spat that the once mighty Netscape had with Microsoft a few years back, I assumed that they still managed to work together to give us HTML4.<br />
Removing browser manufacturers (and employees of other software companies with financial interests) should make the working groups actually function a like working groups and create real standards fairly quickly (yes I heard the horror stories from members of W3C working parties first hand). You will not get a browser manufacturer saying no we can’t have :first-letter because it will take 6,000 lines of code just to implement that standard.<br />
Will removing browser manufacturers and other software companies with financial interests from working groups improve the implementation of standards? I would say it would have the opposite effect. Because they are not involved in the process of creating standards, why should a browser manufacturer implement a standard. There is no legal or major financial reasons for a browser manufacturer to comply to the standards.<br />
So why should a browser manufacturer add :first-letter support as it will take 6,000 lines of code, they might find a quicker solution to implement :first-character for certain elements and only need to write 1000 lines of code. Then you are coding for have a dozen different browsers that all behave quite differently, anybody remeber 1999. Browser manufacturers and other companies with financial interests need to be involved in the making of standards. With most other standards, companies with financial interests are involved in the process.You need browser manufacturers involved to get their buy in. But we need to make sure their position is not dominant, so they can not slow or halt progress on standards that people want. Part of the problem is W3C membership rules which favour big companies and acedemia. That said, unless we change the model big time, the best we can do is lobby the W3C to make the unworking groups more workable by reducing the power/influence browser manufacturers and other companies with financial interests have in the making of standards.&#8221;</p>
