		<description>The technical data is impressing, and indeed Safari is very quick. Anyhow, the blurred fonts do really disturb the nice picture.
Also some of my sites do look different in Safari. One might argue this a problem of development, but infact it is impossible to go along for all browsers.
So I´m sceptic both in view of user and publisher.</description>

		<description>In case we all do not pray for Mac - Mozilla is the best I think. A huge amount of plugins and add-ons are really great. But!! I agree with you guys that on Mac - it&#039;s another story. I think - the future of all the systems is in hands of several men who are to decide: is it enough to have $40+ billions and try to make the life of ordinary users more difficult, or it is a real chance for them to be remembered as the first who had a great idea - unite all in one and build a real standard for both PC and Mac. Don&#039;t kill me here - that&#039;s what I really think</description>

		<description>Acid2 renders perfectly in safari 3 for windows XP.

    I am curious, what are the build versions that people are using, has Apple updated already?

    My build is Version 3.0 (522.11.3), this was tested on a Mac under Bootcamp</description>

		<description>I havn’t had any problems running Safari 3.0 beta on my Windows XP SP2 system. It’s fast, it’s accurate, and it passes the Acid 2 test easily!</description>

		<description>I have tried all the browsers on all operating systems and Safari is the best in a cross platform way (except Linux but Safari&#039;s Webkit is used in Linux browsers).

I would like to use Firefox for day-to-day but it is really hacked on the Mac. I use Firefox at work on my pc solely for the Firebug plug-in. Safari&#039;s Inspector is catching up but still has a way to go.

Even though I have Firefox (and the obligatory ie) open on my pc at work I use Safari for all other browsing since it works very well and is very standards based. 

Firefox is pushing XUL and their own js extensions, IE is pushing proprietary ie-only browsing and Opera isn&#039;t as standards compliant as Safari.

With the release of the iPhone, web sites can no longer ignore Safari without alienating young, rich potential clients. Imagine a fancy restaurant with a slick Flash based site losing out to another restaurant because the potential customer could check the address or phone number on the standards based competitor&#039;s site using her iPhone.

As I wrote this I had fully spell checking and the ability to stretch the size of this text field so I could see the entire post. Cool, advanced features added without breaking standards. That&#039;s the way to build a browser.</description>

		<description>The Safari-Browser for Windows runs perfectly. We need this to develop cross-browser websites and now we don´t need to test it under MacOS.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t like the browser on my Mac. Why should a Windows user, who has access to all this wonderful browsers (Firefox, Opera and ... yes IE7 ;)), use this buggy Safari thingy ?!

What this Apple browser really needs is some styling abilities for web forms - perhaps this should be part of Acid3 ;)</description>

		<description>What I wanted to add, that being a person who deals with lot&#039;s of blog management tasks, I always have to keep in mind that cross-browser features are something I need to check every time. Is there a chance to create something unique in browsers like Google in search? Open source is a nice solution for all the Net applications and I believe we should use them for developing a more flexible platform for navigating the Net.</description>
