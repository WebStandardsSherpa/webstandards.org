			<p>As the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off today, Steve Jobs announced the availability of the Safari 3 Public Beta &#8212; for both Mac and Windows. <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Download it here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only just installed it on Windows XP, but it has frozen once and crashed once already. There are complaints of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000884.html">blurry fonts</a> and <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/07/06/12/0120230.shtml">security bugs</a>. It&#8217;s not rendering <a href="../../../../files/acid2/test.html#top">the Acid2 test</a> correctly. (In fact, it&#8217;s not rendering the WaSP site correctly either. I assume the same is true on the Mac, but can someone verify?)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to send in your bug reports via the <a href="http://webkit.org/quality/reporting.html">WebKit bug reporting form</a> or the browser itself (Help > Report Bugs to Apple).</p>

												<p>[...] Last time when I was reviewing new releases of Windows Web browsers, I was hoping I could get my hands on a Mac&#8212;or at least the money to buy one&#8212;so I could review Safari as well. But, I don&#8217;t think I would be salivating for it any sooner. I was browsing my Live Bookmarks when I saw a post from WaSP announcing the release of Safari 3 Public Beta for Mac and Windows. Yes, you heard it right &#8230; Safari&#8217;s new public beta is made for Windows as well! [...]</p>

												<p>Oops. I just went and published a story on here myself, then realised that you&#8217;d already beaten me to it, Kimmie (hadn&#8217;t spotted in my feeds!). But I thought I&#8217;d add some of my points here in the comments anyway:</p>
<p>But what does this mean to the world of web standards? The browser wars were played out a long time ago &#8211; does this mean that the ceasefire has been broken? Is it a new front being opened up or is it simply a minor skirmish that the rest of the world can turn a blind eye to?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers &#8211; I was surprised as many people, blindly assuming that Safari would always and ever be a Mac-only piece of software &#8211; and I can&#8217;t claim to be massively excited about the prospect of using Safari on Windows. Or at least not until such a time as Firefox extensions, such as the indespensible Web Developer Toolbar, can be made to work in Safari but that&#8217;s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. But that said, I think it&#8217;s a good thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more will testing for Safari be left until the last moment (or at all) &#8211; finally developers can check their work early on</li>
<li>If it really is faster to render pages, that can only be good for the user</li>
<li>Mac users will benefit too, as it will become more difficult to reject support problems on Safari with a simple &quot;Ah but that&#8217;s just a certain percentage (Safari users) of an already small percantage of users (Mac users)&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what&#8217;s your take on this announcement? Exciting? Will it change the browsing landscape massively? Or are you just thinking &quot;meh, whatever&quot;.</p>

												<p>[...] Update 4: The Webkit team and Web Standards Project have weighed in. The Windows version of WebKit should be available later today, which will be nice for following progress on issues as it moves from beta toward final version. It turns out there&#8217;s a regression and at least the Windows version no longer renders the Acid2 test correctly.

												<p>Both the Windows and Mac OS X version of Safari 3 correctly renders the Acid 2 test. However, there have been reports of installation conflicts on Windows when other third-party applications have been installed. </p>

<p>Safari 3 also supports additional CSS borders and background properties, which makes creating rounded corner boxes much easier. </p>

												<p>I think it can only be a good thing. It might, MIGHT even encourage Microsoft to work a little harder at improving IE. Especially when you think of how they used to dominate the Mac browser field with IE5/Mac, then ended its support when Safari came along, and now Safari&#8217;s sitting in their own back yard, virtually taunting IE with its excellent standards support.</p>
<p>Only thing I raise my brow at is their speed claims&#8230;what kind of test puts Opera as the slowest browser for page rendering? And isn&#8217;t IE often faster than Firefox?</p>

												<p>The WaSP site renders correctly in Safari 3 on both Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.4.9 for me. There&#8217;s a problem with navigation text, but Safari is actually rendering what&#8217;s in the CSS properly. The CSS just needs to be updated so that the text-shadow is a different color than the text.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2002 SP 2. So far I&#8217;ve had nothing but problems with Safari. None of the menus have text on them. The only thing I see is hyphens and some bullets. When I hit the report bug button, the program freezes&#8230; I can&#8217;t surf because it won&#8217;t let me type in the address bar. It&#8217;s not even rendering Apple&#8217;s site correctly. I can&#8217;t tell if fonts are blurry because I can&#8217;t see any fonts! None are showing up. Anyone else seeing these problems?<br />

<p>I also wanted to test it on Windows, so I tried it in VMWare, but it got an error before installing saying that it requires Windows Installer 3, and when trying to download that I found out that my Windows had to be genuine, which it is not. :P </p>

												<p>Safari 3 works great for me.  I haven&#8217;t had any of the problems other people have had with it.  </p>
<p>It passed the Acid2 test on both Mac and Windows, which isn&#8217;t surprising since it has passed it since &#8217;05.  Haven&#8217;t had any crashes yet, but since it IS a beta and has never been available on Windows I fully expect it to crash at some point, so I don&#8217;t plan on abandoning it just yet.  :)  Safari is noticably faster than Firefox and IE at rendering every page I&#8217;ve been to so far.  I haven&#8217;t tested it against Opera so I can&#8217;t comment on that.</p>
<p>For those that want to check out Safari&#8217;s plugins and plugin support you can go to pimpmysafari.com.  There are quite a few plugins available for it, though I haven&#8217;t tried loading any of them on my XP version of Safari yet so I have no idea if they work with it or not.  If there&#8217;s a plugin you like on Firefox but it isn&#8217;t available on Safari then by all means feel free to port it.  The Web Developer plugin is an excellent example of one that should be ported if it isn&#8217;t already available.</p>

												<p>Just installed Safari 3.0.2 for Windows XP SP2 today. The fonts are very bold and blurry. It hurts my eyes on my LCD. </p>
<p>Safari has crashed/frozen up on me once so far.</p>
<p>Overall Safari is alright. I haven&#8217;t figured out how to have whatever i type in the address bar appear in a new tab and really dislike not having buttons to add new tabs like every other browser and a Go button since there&#8217;s a lot of times where I&#8217;m just reading at night and operating nothing but the mouse.</p>

												<p>I have the Safari web browser 3.0 beta for Windows XP, and it is running perfectly, and passed the acid 2 test with flying colors.  Safari web browser is the fastest, most accurate, web browser in history.  Opera passes the acid 2 test also, but is rated as the slowest web browser in history.  As proved by Apple, Safari is the fastest web browser out, and now also passes the Acid 2 test, Safari, the only, the fastest, the most accurate, the best, web browser ever created!</p>

												<p>Safari IS great, but not on XP (yet).  SP2 with all the updates crashes too often to be of much use for testing.  Looking forward to a more exhaustive update.</p>
<p>Testing on another XP machine with similar specs produced zero problems and no crashes.  Perhaps it&#8217;s the Windows gremlins after all.</p>

												<p>I would say Safari is a nice alternative to what we have today from Microsoft (IE), but that would be better not to stop on the already achieved. Navigation is something developers will always have to work under with. In general, Safari is a pretty thing to navigate with. I doubt there is a better alternative on the net at the moment.</p>

												<p>What I wanted to add, that being a person who deals with lot&#8217;s of blog management tasks, I always have to keep in mind that cross-browser features are something I need to check every time. Is there a chance to create something unique in browsers like Google in search? Open source is a nice solution for all the Net applications and I believe we should use them for developing a more flexible platform for navigating the Net.</p>

												<p>I have tried all the browsers on all operating systems and Safari is the best in a cross platform way (except Linux but Safari&#8217;s Webkit is used in Linux browsers).</p>
<p>I would like to use Firefox for day-to-day but it is really hacked on the Mac. I use Firefox at work on my pc solely for the Firebug plug-in. Safari&#8217;s Inspector is catching up but still has a way to go.</p>
<p>Even though I have Firefox (and the obligatory ie) open on my pc at work I use Safari for all other browsing since it works very well and is very standards based. </p>
<p>Firefox is pushing XUL and their own js extensions, IE is pushing proprietary ie-only browsing and Opera isn&#8217;t as standards compliant as Safari.</p>
<p>With the release of the iPhone, web sites can no longer ignore Safari without alienating young, rich potential clients. Imagine a fancy restaurant with a slick Flash based site losing out to another restaurant because the potential customer could check the address or phone number on the standards based competitor&#8217;s site using her iPhone.</p>
<p>As I wrote this I had fully spell checking and the ability to stretch the size of this text field so I could see the entire post. Cool, advanced features added without breaking standards. That&#8217;s the way to build a browser.</p>

												<p>In case we all do not pray for Mac &#8211; Mozilla is the best I think. A huge amount of plugins and add-ons are really great. But!! I agree with you guys that on Mac &#8211; it&#8217;s another story. I think &#8211; the future of all the systems is in hands of several men who are to decide: is it enough to have $40+ billions and try to make the life of ordinary users more difficult, or it is a real chance for them to be remembered as the first who had a great idea &#8211; unite all in one and build a real standard for both PC and Mac.

												<p>The technical data is impressing, and indeed Safari is very quick. Anyhow, the blurred fonts do really disturb the nice picture.<br />
Also some of my sites do look different in Safari. One might argue this a problem of development, but infact it is impossible to go along for all browsers.<br />
So I´m sceptic both in view of user and publisher.</p>
