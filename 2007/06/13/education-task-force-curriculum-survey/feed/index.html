		<description>I am working at an English school (I Live in Holland). The funny thing there is that alot of teachers know how to work with a computer. The main reason for this is that the school is 100% operating with Computers (they have an award from Microsoft because of this). What I wanna say is: everyone can PRACTICE, if you practice enough you will learn it, trust me!</description>

		<description>There&#039;s a multitude of factors that need to be addressed, everyone learns the basic web standards a different way...the nature of the internet is often the case of who&#039;s source do you trust more.....Unfortunately learning through the classroom is usually the MOST trusted source even thou the materials used is OFTEN outdated. Those who make a career out of it, learn quickly that following &quot; best practices&quot; where an industry demands it can often effect the bottom line.</description>

		<description>I´m convinced that the most teachers only make their program. Things they heard and learned years ago is only coming every year back to the people. Only the people change but not the word. So where has to be a quality instance.</description>

		<description>It is a role of a teacher to show a student the right ways and practices but then it is up to the student to do something about it, to develop and to eventually attain the desired goals. It can’t be denied that it is sometimes difficult to find good quality “instructors’ and that educational system is going down, although not everything can be blamed on the system imperfections. It is mostly a matter of individual engagement and talent that can actually overcome all the obstacles.  But on the other hand there are very few people who are able to manage their careers on their own, they need a sort of constant assisstanse from PROPERLY EDUCATED EXPERTS WHO CAN SHOW THEM HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DONE. Therefore it is  great that The WaSP Education Task Force and W3C Quality Assurance Interest Group proposed the creation of such a  curriculum framework . A very good initiative in my opinion and great that something is done in this respect.</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t agree with Steve&#039;s comment that &quot;education is bad for every artist/designer etc. because it gives template thinking First of all, designer must have a his own point of view, not somebody’s else. Education gives some point of view, and then we have works that looks each other&quot;. 
I&#039;m going to study computer graphics but at the moment i can&#039;t say anything about the quality of education in that direction in my country.  As I was saying in my opinion some artists/designers need eductaion some other don&#039;t. eductaion isn&#039;t bad for every artist/designer. Some born with unique style and they create breathtaking art easily. Other develop their talents in different ways. Eductation makes the point of view wider. As someone above said &quot;Life is a long way, and some guidelines are very helpful&quot; you won&#039;t lose your individuality by listening to others and by getting to know other concepts.</description>

		<description>Good initiative. I had good examples on best pratices but not studied in English... So I guess I was lucy. 

I will keep track of the developments and post on them on Axistive.</description>

		<description>steve says art education gives template thinking which is untrue. You get the basics with education and develop it with participation. I have been to Academy of Art College in SF and i am glad about the education and the vision they offered. Before that I didn&#039;t even know i was missing those but i must admit that some people are really gifted.

Life is a long way, and some guidelines are very helpful. But the thing we are discussing is not the education itself, but the quality of it.</description>

Education gives some point of view, and then we have works that looks each other.
Maybe it&#039;s bad example, but Artemy Lebedev (#1 designer in russia) doesnt have art education at all. But he is at top.</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Leading companies and corporations are beginning to look for and hire those with knowledge of and experience with standards and or web accessibility. &lt;em&gt;Are students able to apply for those jobs?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Are those getting the jobs coming from educational backgrounds where they have received the information and training?&lt;/em&gt; If not, programs need to be updated.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Often, students are asked or required to communicate or produce their projects or works in digital format. As more and more educational institutions use the computer and digital medium for instruction, communication, and student work this becomes true across a variety of fields of study, not just engineering, programming, design, or web technology studies. &lt;em&gt;Have all students been given best practice basics?&lt;/em&gt; When students are asked for a term paper, report, or project they are often given instruction, style guides, rules, or standards to follow.  I imagine that the criteria to meet is not at the same level for digital work, and I do not believe that they are given proper information about web standards basics when creating such work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn how to write a sentence, a report, or paper in our education -- we need to be teaching standards basics for those who will be communicating or working digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former WaSP lead Molly Holzschlag has begun to put together a program of her own, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molly.com/2007/06/20/train-the-trainer-program/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Train The Trainer Program&lt;/a&gt; (also see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molly.com/2007/06/24/train-the-trainer-dates-for-september-and-october/&quot; title=&quot;Train the Trainer Dates for September and October&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recent update&lt;/a&gt; ) I think this is a great idea. I think some of us may be able to go to local libraries, visit a few schools and offer some time to help train or acquaint educators and others about standards. Schools in the United States often have faculty institute days or workshops where teachers learn new skills, information, or techniques, and getting web standards and best practices into these venues might be a good way to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we teach advanced web technology topics to students who do not know the basics or standards? How can we teach basics and standards without knowledge of the same?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&quot;I don’t really see why it should be the universities’ job to teach web development og -design, at least not as part of master’s programs.&quot;

@TK, I was talking more along the lines of seeing the bigger picture of web development, not learning how to code or using Adobe.

For example, learning about web development on a corporate (larger) level or incorporating some business aspects in your learning.

Advanced courses could be taught in framework design and in underlying methods and concepts.  Adobe and PHP functions could be taught in undergrad levels.

Engineering school?  No.  We are not Engineers.  Part of university curriculum?  Why Not?  It would help our field.</description>
