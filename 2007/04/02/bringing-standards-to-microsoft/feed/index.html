		<description>Rob...

Two of the leading lights at Opera were the ones who did the heaviest lifting on Acid2, notwithstanding the fact that their own production title doesn&#039;t pass (if I recall correctly).

Several of our roster have a long history of activity with regard to Firefox development.

...And while no census has been taken, I imagine that OSX, BSD, and Linux uare likely the majority within WaSP when it comes to daily use and production.

Finally, the &#8220;WaSP member&#8221; to whom you refer has since moved onto Emeritus status at her own request.

So.

In bed with whom, exactly?

If anything, we&#039;re in a proverbial cuddle puddle with a whole bunch of vendors, and in my opinion that&#8217;s how it &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be, unless and until that does net damage to the accomplishment of WaSP&#8217;s mission.</description>

		<description>So now there&#039;s a regular update from Microsoft and a WASP member now works for Microsoft and there are regular reports about Microsoft and when was the last time you did anything equivalent with Mozilla or Opera or any other browser and please tell me again that you aren&#039;t in bed with Microsoft.

You are like Microsoft.  You deny, deny, deny any involvement and act incredulous that anyone would insinuate such a thing yet.....here we are.</description>

		<description>Putting similar policies and processes in place for any design and development environment, large or small, would be a monumental step forward for not only the cause of Web standards, but improving the quality of the Web itself.</description>

		<description>Very Nice hope to see some improvements in how Microsoft deals with its standards based web related products. wouldn&#039;t it be great if the new Web Expression coded in valid XHTML 1.1.</description>
