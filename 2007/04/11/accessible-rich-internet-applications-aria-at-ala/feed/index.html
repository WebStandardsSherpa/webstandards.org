		<description>As Rolf Beckmann said: &quot;I think the web 2.0 time is over and there are many tools to create a web 3.0 standart.&quot;

I just wrote about this term &quot;web 3.0&quot; an examination wich leads to the conclusion, that web 2.0 with all it&#039;s user generated, api based content will not rule the internet as many people think. User want simple functionality &quot;that works&quot;. Users  are dreamin&#039; from a google that knows, what you want and gives you SERPs without Blackhat-SEO spam sites. We&#039;re dreamin&#039; of intelligent spam filters that are not keyword based... We&#039;re dreamin of true human understanding, -of simulated intelligence. This will be &quot;Web 3.0&quot;!</description>

		<description>Tis article is great. I think the web 2.0 time is over and there are many tools to create a web 3.0 standart. I think it is a mean to manipulate the webbrowser. first plug ins are tabbed browsing, etc. I agree with the first comment tha Aria is a nice tool for future</description>

		<description>Good article Martin, well done. The more this topic comes into focus I think that while WAI ARIA comes in for criticism due to lack of vendor support or the potential for it to gradually become a non-standard standard -  it is at the very least an important step forward for those who wish to experiment with the potential that the expanded semantics that the Role and State modules offer.</description>

		<description>Mmh, perhaps Aria is a nice Tool for future Webapplications but I think, that the web (3.0) won&#039;t use a browser or something but will be implemented in programms (like windows) and mobile devices. Widgets will become more important also.</description>
