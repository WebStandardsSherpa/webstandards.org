			<p>David Storey, Chief Web Opener at Opera Software, announces on his blog today <a href="http://my.opera.com/dstorey/blog/show.dml/701902">CSS3 support in the development of the Opera browser</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Most people don&#8217;t have the privilege of testing out our latest internal builds, which will go into a future release of our browser, so I thought I&#8217;d share with you some of the great work our developers have been up to in regards to CSS3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Storey provides a look at the focus on selector support, what currently is supported, what is in the engine but not enabled and what is being prioritized down the road.</p>

												<p>Firefox/Mozilla are XUL bloated so I use Opera on my old PCs instead.</p>

<p>Are you talking about Opera or MSIE?</p>
<blockquote><p>Who uses Opera these days anyway?</p></blockquote>
<p>I do. Seriously, Opera is known for not investing too much for ad campaign, spreading the word, etc.<br />
Maybe they&#8217;ll decide to do that sometime? Right now Opera has the advantage MS nor Mozilla have: being embedded on mobile phones, PDAs and game console(s). I think they&#8217;re going in the right way.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m not a professional webdesigner, but experience showed me that one _should_ actually care about those IE users. I do care for the v6, and that&#8217;s really hard when you use modern techniques. Indeed, MS&#8217;s browser, so MS, are the responsible for slowing the Web development process to semantics and standards.</p>
<p>So I asked you Daniel, because compared to Opera, it&#8217;s IE that has a lot of work to do on CSS2 support.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is my opinion that Opera should’ve tried to fully comply with CSS2 and XHTML before they jump on the CSS3 wagon, but then again, it’s not my company.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../../2006/07/20/acid2-and-opera-9-clarifications/index.html" rel="nofollow">Opera passed Acid 2</a>.  I don&#8217;t know what you claim is missing, but it appears they did <strong>try</strong> to comply with CSS2.  Plus, I imagine CSS3 compatibility ought to include CSS2 and CSS1.  Implementing CSS2 does not stop when implementation of CSS3 starts, I would hope.</p>
<blockquote><p>And I don’t really give a crap what crap (or not) Microsoft pushes anymore, since I don’t care about the people who uses it anymore, nor use it myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t hire you as a web designer.  I hope for the sake of potential clients that you aren&#8217;t. Entirely ignoring the browser with the highest market share is not beneficial.  If you aren&#8217;t a designer by profession, then more power (but I still wouldn&#8217;t ignore them 100%, as conditional comments really make supporting IE trivial).</p>

												<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>This thread is not about Microsoft nor Internet Explorer. It is about Opera adding partial CSS3 support!</p>
<p>1. No Opera do not fully comply with the CSS2 recommendations.<br />
2. I would&#8217;ve assumed it wiser to first comply to that before starting to work on CSS3 support.<br />
3. Entirely my personal opinion.<br />
4. And a strange one to some apparently.</p>

												<p>It will be nice to showcase some CSS designs using some of the new CSS3 support. Maybe it might blow my mind, but CSS Zen Garden already did that :)</p>

												<p>That&#8217;s exactly <em>my</em> point, you know, quiris.</p>
<p>Why else would I care about Opera, if there was already a compliant browser out there? Then that battle would&#8217;ve already been won for me, you know!</p>
<p>So, the more the reason to get one there then (!) instead of cutting corners for CSS3. Or do you just want the flashy next-gen stuff like AJAX and gimmicky style tricks and other bullshit? Well. Then you&#8217;re against me.</p>

												<p>Because we are adding CSS3 support, doesn&#8217;t mean we are skimping on CSS2.  We have many engineers that work on different modules and different areas of the code.  It is not an exclusive or.  It maybe that adding something from CSS3 is easier to add while working on the same part of the code base for another feature or bug, or it maybe that one property, such as opacity, starts to get widely used and needs to be supported for compatibility reasons.  We want to support all of CSS2.1 as much as the next person.  </p>
<p>Most pages out there aren&#8217;t written to spec, so even if we were bug free in CSS2 and 3 there would still be a lot of work to do in making sure the error fallback is consistent with the browsers people test on.  This is a bigger problem in quirksmode, than standards mode where there is a more specified way of handling errors.  Then of course there is all the vendor specific features that the major sites insist on using, and we have to look into whether we have to support, and then reverse engineer them as there is no spec to base our support on.  That takes a large amount of time.  Thankfully some of the more useful vendor specific extensions are getting spec&#8217;d out by the likes of the WHAT-WG.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love Opera to be the first browser to fully comply with CSS2.1 though.  We also have a very good DOM level 2 support, where in Opera 9 we support all the interfaces, and we are well on the road with DOM Level 3.  </p>
<p>I think all the major browsers are doing good work with picking up the standards baton at present.  It should be an exciting few years as the IE team pick up the pace.</p>

												<p>Well here&#8217;s my tip of the day, David:</p>
<p>1. Put all style engineers on fixing CSS2 (and possibly even some CSS1) compliance in accordance with W3C recommendations.<br />
2. Don&#8217;t bother about faulty code. The err is at the other end and you shouldn&#8217;t patch up other&#8217;s errors at your end. Unless you wanna be as stupid as every sucker here who works for free for IE6 because they like to cover Microsoft&#8217;s hairy ass.<br />
3. After you&#8217;ve quality assured/secured CSS1+2+2.1 <em>then</em> you can read into CSS3 specs and try to comply to them.</p>
<p>Anyway, you said: &#8220;I think all the major browsers are doing good work with picking up the standards baton at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s gotta be a joke. Both Mozilla.com and Mircosoft clearly misinterprets and disrespect W3C recommendations on purpose to make money.</p>
<p>That ranted. Thanks, Opera, for being the best out there yet (at least). You show promise, but you could still do much better. Good fortune, David.</p>

												<p>Peter. In my opinion. You&#8217;re the one being an idiot. For heck, it wouldn&#8217;t be the most used browser if you didn&#8217;t work for free to cover for Microsoft!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d just respected web content recommendations the browsers would&#8217;ve already been there to pick up the content, and we wouldn&#8217;t have fought this largely pointless bad browser vs. designer war for 5+ years without nearly any results on Microsoft&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>For example, how hard do you think it really is to fix IE to catch &#8220;application/xhtml+xml&#8221; too and not only &#8220;text/html&#8221;? It takes less than a 1000 USD effort and less than an 1 hour. So just start collectively blocking out valuable content from disrespectful browsers and Microsoft&#8217;ll be there in no-time patching it up, I promise.</p>
<p>When people like you, and Yahia, say things like &#8220;Indeed, MS’s browser, so MS, are the responsible for slowing the Web development process to semantics and standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;re just bullshitting! You can choose semantics and standards today! And people, organizations and companies can get your content by using one of many free, pretty compliant, crossplatform browsers.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the ones who are slowing down the progress! You&#8217;re the ones who disrepsect web content recommendation! Now stop covering Microsoft’s hairy ass and do something progressive for once!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>As for the news on Opera &amp; CSS3 complaince &#8211; its good to see the company moving forward and spending time on the next stage of CSS. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Opera now for around three years, and find it a refreshing change from IE. When developing websites, I tend to write it for Opera, check it in firefox, and fix in IE. I cannot imagine a time when I wouldn&#8217;t have to run it through IE &#8211; the majority of web surfers use IE, mainly because none of them understand that there is an alternative.</p>

												<p>Most web developers working for a company (any company) value their employment higher than they do web standards. Their bosses won&#8217;t be convinced that there&#8217;s something more important than that the company&#8217;s website looks good on the most used browser.</p>
<p>So in the vast majority of situations, you think web developers should lose or risk losing their jobs due to Microsoft&#8217;s laziness? The web standards cause is important to me, but not that important. </p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m surprised the larger companies that must spend the most additional money to facilitate designing for IE don&#8217;t put more pressure on Microsoft&#8230;don&#8217;t they have enough collective influence to force them into writing some extra code easy enough that a two-man operation like the iCab developers can even do?

												<p>Daniel Gr, while I said that MS&#8217; IE is slowing the process of moving towards more advanced standards-compliance, you shouldn&#8217;t deduce that all people who make websites compatible with IE don&#8217;t respect standards. Personnaly, it just avoids me the use of some fancy CSS selectors, and add up only 1 extra div somewhere, that&#8217;s all.<br />
Roger said &#8220;I tend to write it for Opera, check it in firefox, and fix in IE.&#8221; What I do is write and go check on the three browsers, to catch a small error that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to fix quickly &amp; painlessly if I had written a large amount of code.<br />
This is to tell you, Daniel Gr, that I recently make my websites highly standards-compliant, and working as good as in the three browsers.<br />
Also, if you think that having a website written in the useless XHTML and _served application/xhtml+xml_ for nothing, then you&#8217;re wrong. If you were good, you would be off using HTML 4.01. But maybe you still don&#8217;t know about this stuff. I checked the website you&#8217;re under in your comments BTW, and found very funny the way it&#8217;s coded, without me getting to details. But you seem to not know what semantics and standards really stand for.<br />
And I don&#8217;t believe that a pressure from enterprises can push MS to do something or change something, when we know there are still people browsing the Web with IE5, IE5.5, NS6+, etc. And even with IE7&#8242;s release, which isn&#8217;t an improvement, we&#8217;ll still have IE6&#8242;s bugs to fix for years. And IE7 is just another bug bag.<br />
Bottomline, Daniel, save us your rant, and do that on your blog instead. And make it compliant to your web content ;)<br />
BTW, I don&#8217;t understand why Opera has to &#8220;fix&#8221; something like a specific CNN&#8217;s front-page or similar issues. Isn&#8217;t that helping to make big corporations NOT Caring at all about web standards?</p>

												<p>I think my opinions are valid, but of course they are <em>my opinions.</em> Be happy to disagree. I still think you&#8217;re wrong, <strong>Peter.</strong> Feel free to think the same about what I think. I just like the discussion and freedom of opinion. And I think I triggered some really crucial thoughts to be uttered here, above my own, so I can&#8217;t really see how I&#8217;m &#8220;hurting the web standards movement&#8221; when all I do is expand on points of views.</p>
<p>That you can&#8217;t stand personal criticism (though, perhaps, put bluntly) is really your problem. I&#8217;m fine with any criticism. I consider all criticism, even yours. And though I think you&#8217;re basically wrong, you&#8217;re still valid to some point (from your perspective).</p>
<p><strong>Yahia.</strong> You&#8217;re mostly right, and I&#8217;m sorry if you took personal offense. But &#8220;if you think that having a website written in the useless XHTML and <em>served application/xhtml+xml</em> for nothing, then you’re wrong. If you were good, you would be off using HTML 4.01.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a 10 year old standard that is not XML? How progressive.. Well, we just prioritize different, I guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;I checked the website you’re under in your comments BTW, and found very funny the way it’s coded, without me getting to details. But you seem to not know what semantics and standards really stand for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what web standards are, no, I use W3C Web Recommendations. I&#8217;m humble like that.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t really gotten into much semantics in (X)HTML yet. If you&#8217;re talking specifically about jaspoid.com, I can only say it shows what I want to show in a text browser and a graphical one. That is two links with title attribute descriptions. I&#8217;m still trying to discuss CSS3 in Opera before CSS2 here though, so, it&#8217;s kind of off track to review my websites perhaps..</p>
<p>But please send any criticism to <a href="mailto:d@wordly.org">d@wordly.org</a> and I&#8217;ll be happy to try to improve.</p>

<p>The browser usage stats represented by IE 5.x users makes it very acceptable to not test in IE 5.x (released some 8+ years ago) and to not bother about IE 5.x. Remember that if your website is well designed, then webpage content should still be accessible and navigation should be functional in any browser (text browsers, non-javascript browsers, non-css browsers, etc).<br />
As for NS 6 and NS 7, the browser usage stats represented by NS 6/7 users is even lower and if your webpage layout displays accordingly, as expected in, say, Firefox 2, then there is a fair chance it will look good in NS 7.2.</p>

<p>IE7 is a clear and definite improvement (over IE6) in my opinion. I nevertheless agree with you that IE7 still has lots of bugs, incorrect implementations, incomplete CSS2.1/DOM2/HTML4 support, incomplete or buggy support for CSS 2.1, HTML 4 and for DOM 2.</p>

												<p>Did I ever sound offended, Peter? It&#8217;s a matter of personal opinion of course, but I thought you did, while I sure wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>My final words. Yes, I think you reduce yourself to less than worthy if you work for IE and stupid managers. Yes, I think this war would&#8217;ve already been won if you hadn&#8217;t gone and patched everything up for IE &#8211; even when there&#8217;s free, fully-functioning browsers out there for everyone to get and use.</p>
<p>And, yes, you do <em>de facto</em> work but for Microsoft to cover for them when you spend time fixing already good resources just to patch up for bugs at the other end. And that makes you an idiot to me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

												<p>Gérard, you&#8217;re right. Even, the few websites I designed untill now are ergonomically navigable without any CSS, and pass minimum WCAG1 p1.<br />
Talking about IE7, I would have preferred they redo the bells and whistles and keep the engine still, as IE6&#8242;s &#8212; like they did for XHTML&#8217;s MIME support. Because all the CSS hacks that used to work fine, now they don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not one of those ugly CSS hacks that leave you with an unvalid stylesheet, so the solution that one has is including styles with conditional comments (I believe).</p>

												<p>Thank you, Jordan. Very constructive comment on CSS and web standards there. Just for you, I&#8217;ve decided not to leave this thread alone though I said I would. (Yes, that would mean I lied.) Welcome, Jordan!</p>
<p>1. There&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;conditional comments&#8221; in any standard. Comments are for comments. Everything else is semantically incorrect.</p>
<p>2. There&#8217;s still no need hacking for Internet Explorer, since people are free to choose a browser with a standards-compliant rendering engine.</p>
<p>3. You&#8217;re just wasting your precious time doing disgraceful hacks (while you could be adding creative content, better service, or improving your accessibility). Shame on you, I say.</p>

Most people have to use the browser supplied by the organisation they work for and that almost always means IE. Downloading anything else is often a disciplinary offence.</p>

												<p>Who&#8217;s the troll, anyway, <strong>zooplah</strong>? Not like you&#8217;re posting any constructive criticism on web standards nor CSS3 in Opera, right? More like <em>you</em>&#8216;re picking on people totally off-topic and, thus, being the troll yourself.</p>
<p>If you really read what I said, instead of bothering with how I said it, you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;m one of the more constructive people on this thread. My god!</p>
<p>I know that, <strong>Ted</strong>, but there&#8217;s usually no good reason why that organization would deny people to use a better, free browser &#8211; except not knowing there&#8217;s a demand for a better choice. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about people uniting for change and convincing the computer network administrators. It does take an effort, but it&#8217;s usually possible to bring change &#8211; and, infact, I&#8217;ve done it myself in several places (at a universities, a college and a media company).</p>

												<p>Daniel: For somebody who has consumed this entire page with his ego, I think it is a bit rich to start questioning other people&#8217;s input.</p>
<p>I actually quite agree with a lot of what you say, eg. <abbr title="Conditional Comment">CC</abbr>s <em>are</em> technically invalid, and yes, they <em>are</em> a hack.</p>
<p>But the point that some others here are trying to get across is that, like it or not, IE is the predominant browser and to ignore that displays arrogance at the least.</p>
<p>Try telling the averge web user that your site is perfect, but IE has a &#8220;rendering&#8221; bug&#8230; see how far you get. Unfortunately, in the real world hacks are a necessary evil, and the last time I checked, they&#8217;ve never really hurt anybody.</p>

												<p>Well, there we diagree. Hacks are &#8211; to me &#8211; an unnecessary evil. I&#8217;ve converted plenty of average users, and I think we could have converted pretty much the whole lot by now if we&#8217;d gone together, sticked to the recommendations and accepted poor support from the ost used browser.</p>
<p>I can just state &#8211; from my own experience &#8211; that most of my projects (that only have about 10 000 unique users in total / monthly, but still) already have about 60% compliant browsers (<strong>20% Opera</strong>, 40% Gecko), 30% Internet Explorer 6+ users, and 10% other (older or unknown) browsers. And I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll really be a problem converting most of those 40% to switch when I start working actively with gving them credit for doing just that &#8211; in exchange for giving me less work for bugchecking and instead providing a better user experience overall.</p>
<p>Currently even I spend a few 100 dollars a year on Internet Explorer. But I&#8217;ll rather spend this money on converting my 4000 &#8220;web standards ignorant&#8221; users. And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be worth at least a dollar a head, in the end.</p>

												<p>And even if wide media services, like mail.ru*, only has about 9% Opera users and 7% Gecko users. IE6 has lost 6% to IE7 and another 6% to Opera+Gecko since last year. So yes, a lot of people are still Microsoft loyal, but it&#8217;s not static and impossible to make an impact on.</p>
<p>&#8211;<br />
* I&#8217;m using mail.ru as an example since it&#8217;s one of few really big sites &#8211; Alexa Rank #31 &#8211; with <a href="http://top3.mail.ru/stat?id=110605;what=sys;period=1;date=2007-1-15" rel="nofollow">public stats</a>.</p>

<p>Why are <abbr title="Conditional Comment">CC</abbr>s <em>technically</em> invalid?<br />
There&#8217;s only one <abbr title="Conditional Comment">CC</abbr>-Syntax that is truly invalid (because it&#8217;s no comment at all) and I&#8217;ve never seen it in actual use.<br />
Comments are comments, they may contain almost everything. The syntax of <abbr title="Conditional Comment">CC</abbr>s is in no way a problem for parsers or validators.<br />
Invalid is the interpretation of it&#8217;s contents in MS products. However, in later versions of Internet Explorer they should be obsoleted by the better standard compilance.</p>
<p>In my opinion <abbr title="Conditional Comment">CC</abbr>s are a great invention. Without them modern CSS-based designing would be a lot harder (or probably <em>more dirty</em>).</p>

<p>Or one could just use CSS2.1 according to W3C recommendations, that&#8217;s supported in several free, good browsers?</p>

<p>Old software does not support standards. Didn’t we mention that already? It would be swell if we could have backward compatibility and pure standards compliance. But we can’t. We have to choose. For years, most of us have chosen backward compatibility. But is this really the best choice?</p>
<p>For years, we’ve been taught to be good little web designers, building sites that work in browsers that don’t. Each site we build the old-fashioned way becomes one more dung heap of bad code, one more web destination that will eventually stop working as browsers and standards evolve.</p>
<p>The longer we do it, the more doomed sites proliferate. Thousands of new sites premiere every day. Most of them are built to support bad browsers intead of standards. It’s an epidemic. Enough already. We finally have good browsers. Let’s use them.&#8221;

												<p>IE7 is a clear and definite improvement (over IE6) in my opinion. I nevertheless agree with you that IE7 still has lots of bugs, incorrect implementations, incomplete CSS2.1/DOM2/HTML4 support, incomplete or buggy support for CSS 2.1, HTML 4 and for DOM 2.</p>
