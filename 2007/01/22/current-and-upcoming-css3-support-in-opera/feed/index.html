		<description>IE7 is a clear and definite improvement (over IE6) in my opinion. I nevertheless agree with you that IE7 still has lots of bugs, incorrect implementations, incomplete CSS2.1/DOM2/HTML4 support, incomplete or buggy support for CSS 2.1, HTML 4 and for DOM 2.

Nice Prog but Firefox is much better.

&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t you offer backward compatibility?&lt;/strong&gt;

Old software does not support standards. Didn’t we mention that already? It would be swell if we could have backward compatibility and pure standards compliance. But we can’t. We have to choose. For years, most of us have chosen backward compatibility. But is this really the best choice?

For years, we’ve been taught to be good little web designers, building sites that work in browsers that don’t. Each site we build the old-fashioned way becomes one more dung heap of bad code, one more web destination that will eventually stop working as browsers and standards evolve.

The longer we do it, the more doomed sites proliferate. Thousands of new sites premiere every day. Most of them are built to support bad browsers intead of standards. It’s an epidemic. Enough already. We finally have good browsers. Let’s use them.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;HTML comments were supposed to be readable comments - relevant to the code, Daniel. SGML has a goal to be both readable and typable, you know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I do understand your point. However, if I&#039;d write my comments in some secret language no one else understood. Would they be technically invalid as well?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me spell it out loud, once and for all: &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft deserves broken rendering in their browsers.&lt;/strong&gt;
And Let me spell out what is important, once and for all: &lt;strong&gt;It’s only important that one use Web Content Recommendations that is available to all through some browser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Honestly, I completely understand your point of view. I think it&#039;s the wrong one though.
Let me spell it out loud, once and for all: &lt;strong&gt;Customers and visitors of your website should be your top priority. Not some hateress agains Microsoft (even if they deserved it)&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

		<description>Daniel Gr - or is that Grrrrrrrrr!? - at the risk of spawning another 5 replies, you wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m sorry, but I don’t like intolerants, Ian. So you’ll be thankful to hear I won’t comment here anymore. Since you daren’t learn anything from deviating opinions (and people with a different vocabulary than your own), what’s the point me commenting here, really, anyway?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that I didn&#039;t ask you not to express an opinion, nor did I say anything that suggested I do not value your opinion. All I asked is that you have a little self-restraint as far as the profanities are concerned. That has *nothing* to do with having a rich vocabulary - it&#039;s simply a measure of politeness. One can have a discussion without resorting to swearing, or at least in this arena, and in my experience, this has always been the case.

Am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; being unreasonable asking for you to cut out the profanities?</description>

		<description>HTML comments were supposed to be readable comments - relevant to the code, Daniel. SGML has a goal to be both readable and typable, you know.

W3C didn&#039;t add comments for Microsoft to use as browser negotiation hacks. They are for explanatory expansions of what the HTML code is for.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Without them modern CSS-based designing would be a lot harder (or probably more dirty).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or one could just use CSS2.1 according to W3C recommendations, that&#039;s supported in several free, good browsers?

Sigh. Stop frickin&#039; working around everything for the sake of Microsoft! They&#039;re bad - so let &#039;em be, and give them what they deserve! Broken rendering in their shitty browsers.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually quite agree with a lot of what you say, eg. &lt;abbr title=&quot;Conditional Comment&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;s &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; technically invalid, and yes, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a hack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Why are &lt;abbr title=&quot;Conditional Comment&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;s &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; invalid?
There&#039;s only one &lt;abbr title=&quot;Conditional Comment&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;-Syntax that is truly invalid (because it&#039;s no comment at all) and I&#039;ve never seen it in actual use.
Comments are comments, they may contain almost everything. The syntax of &lt;abbr title=&quot;Conditional Comment&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;s is in no way a problem for parsers or validators.
Invalid is the interpretation of it&#039;s contents in MS products. However, in later versions of Internet Explorer they should be obsoleted by the better standard compilance.

In my opinion &lt;abbr title=&quot;Conditional Comment&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;s are a great invention. Without them modern CSS-based designing would be a lot harder (or probably &lt;em&gt;more dirty&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

		<description>And even if wide media services, like mail.ru*, only has about 9% Opera users and 7% Gecko users. IE6 has lost 6% to IE7 and another 6% to Opera+Gecko since last year. So yes, a lot of people are still Microsoft loyal, but it&#039;s not static and impossible to make an impact on.

* I&#039;m using mail.ru as an example since it&#039;s one of few really big sites - Alexa Rank #31 - with &lt;a href=&quot;http://top3.mail.ru/stat?id=110605;what=sys;period=1;date=2007-1-15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;public stats&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

		<description>Well, there we diagree. Hacks are - to me - an unnecessary evil. I&#039;ve converted plenty of average users, and I think we could have converted pretty much the whole lot by now if we&#039;d gone together, sticked to the recommendations and accepted poor support from the ost used browser.

I can just state - from my own experience - that most of my projects (that only have about 10 000 unique users in total / monthly, but still) already have about 60% compliant browsers (&lt;strong&gt;20% Opera&lt;/strong&gt;, 40% Gecko), 30% Internet Explorer 6+ users, and 10% other (older or unknown) browsers. And I don&#039;t think there&#039;ll really be a problem converting most of those 40% to switch when I start working actively with gving them credit for doing just that - in exchange for giving me less work for bugchecking and instead providing a better user experience overall.

Currently even I spend a few 100 dollars a year on Internet Explorer. But I&#039;ll rather spend this money on converting my 4000 &quot;web standards ignorant&quot; users. And I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be worth at least a dollar a head, in the end.</description>
