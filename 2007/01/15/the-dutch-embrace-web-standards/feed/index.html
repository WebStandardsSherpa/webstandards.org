		<description>We don’t have a ‘Web Guidelines police’ that arrests you when you use a BLINK tag or B instead of STRONG. It’s more the ‘comply or explain’ principle: the level of compliance is made visible and compared with that of similar websites. People that are hindered by the lack of compliance have a much stronger position when they complain about than without the legislation. For website owners, compliance (and showing proof of compliance) has become part of their risk management.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s certainly a good thing that a government does not support one certain (dominating) browser brand (IE).
Very good to &#039;impose&#039; the W3 standard instead of the microsoft standard. It hopefully breaks microsoft&#039;s monopoly and gives other (better ) browsers a fair chance. 
Maybe microsoft will finally intoduce a modern browser (IE 8, service pack 10 ?).</description>

		<description>[...] De Overheid.nl Webrichtlijnen lijken de laatste tijd steeds vaker te worden besproken. Nederlands scripting guru Peter-Paul Koch is zeer te spreken over de richtlijnen, en Dean Edwards bij Webstandards.org schenkt er ook aandacht aan. Één van de redenen voor deze (positieve) aandacht is het feit dat de overheid met deze Webrichtlijnen geen poging doet om het wiel opnieuw uit te vinden; de Webrichtlijen voegen juist additionele en specifiekere kwaliteitscriteria toe aan bestaande richtlijnen, zoals WCAG 1.0. Het recente Besluit Kwaliteit Rijksoverheidswebsites zal er geleidelijk voor zorgen dat de toegankelijkheid van deze websites verbeterd wordt. [...]</description>

		<description>We are having enough trouble persuading our managers that our web sites should be accessible (despite the legal requirements). 

Hooray for Holland, and may the Uk follow suit.</description>

		<description>I was impressed not by the idea to force some one to do some thing, but buy the *care* about citizens shown buy the government. 

The government do not apply rules to others, but to themselfs!!!</description>

		<description>Hooray and kudos to Holland! This is a very important step in the right direction for web standards. Let&#039;s hope other governments follow Holland&#039;s example and implement something along the same lines!</description>

		<description>@Wilco: you do have a point here. This &#039;call for webstandards&#039; coming from the government is new for a lot (not all!) web developers. A nice challenge for them I think :-).

Some of us in Dutch government make it happen with web developers &#039;in house&#039;. Go and see at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minvws.nl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the website of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport&lt;/a&gt;.

		<description>Well, I work for a Dutch governmental department, and Webstandards are my main concern. For the sites we have created; we *will* pull it off.
Just you wait and see...</description>

		<description>First of all, it&#039;s great to see that most replies are positive. Three years ago, the information provided by www.webstandards.org was of great help to us when we were developing the Web Guidelines.

The legislation that came around in 2006 is &#039;just&#039; one of the aspects that was put into place and that is where the approach chosen in the Netherlands differs frommost other countries. The starting point was, that all citizens in the Netherlands (should) have the right to be able to access information and services that the government makes available online. In our opinion, WCAG is not the solution, but an important component. 
The line that was chosen:

strengthen procurement by building a normative framework in which build quality is defined (i.e. the Web Guidelines),
make build quality measurable (see http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/toets) with an automated test tool that is highly compliant with UWEM 1.0 (see http://www.wabcluster.org/uwem1/),
integrate a well-defined &lt;em&gt;manual&lt;/em&gt; inspection for accessibility based on WCAG 1.0 priority 1 (see http://www.drempelvrij.nl/ (Dutch) and http://www.accessibility.nl/toetsing/waarmerkdrempelvrij (English))
develop large scale testing and reporting tools for benchmarking purposes (see http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/monitor for the test results and http://www.advies.overheid.nl/monitor for the benchmark)
offer support


The Web guidelines were seen as a valuable component of a style guide that was developed by the central government for their own web sites (see http://stijlgids.overheid.nl/). In the style guide aspects such as a common look and feel, structure and usability are defined. Application of the Web Guidelines is designated &#039;mandatory&#039; in the style guide.

I&#039;m writing this to make clear that we don&#039;t have &#039;just&#039; legislation, or that legislation was the starting point of a development in the Netherlands. Legislation can be seen as one of the components in our &#039;toolbox&#039;. All components are needed to make things work. So the legislation is not (just) a political statement.

We don&#039;t have a &#039;Web Guidelines police&#039; that arrests you when you use a BLINK tag or B instead of STRONG. It&#039;s more the &#039;comply or explain&#039; principle: the level of compliance is made visible and compared with that of similar websites. People that are hindered by the lack of compliance have a much stronger position when they complain about than without the legislation. For website owners, compliance (and showing proof of compliance) has become part of their risk management.

At present, &#039;only&#039; 59 of all 125 Web Guidelines can be tested in a reliable and well-described way. At present, a normative document is being developed to cover all Web Guidelines.

Some examples of web sites with a high level of compliance are http://www.minvws.nl en http://www.regels-stadskanaal.nl.

One unfortunate thing is that most information available is in Dutch only. More information in English is high on my wish list. The previous version of the Web Guidelines was translated and is still available on http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/archive/version1.1/english/. This old version gives a good impression of what&#039;s in the Web Guidelines. In the current version, the distinction between a &lt;em&gt;&#039;minimum set&#039;&lt;/em&gt; and an &lt;em&gt;&#039;optimum set&#039;&lt;/em&gt; of Web Guidelines was abolished: version 1.2 consists of only one set to which websites have to comply.

As of today, an article on the developments around the Web Guidelines is available on http://www.naarvoren.nl/artikel/webrichtlijnen/; I&#039;ll try to translate it some time soon.
