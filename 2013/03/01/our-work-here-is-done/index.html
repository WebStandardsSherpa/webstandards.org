			<p>When The Web Standards Project (WaSP) formed in 1998, the web was the battleground in an ever-escalating war between two browser makers—Netscape and Microsoft—who were each taking turns “advancing” HTML to the point of collapse. You see, in an effort to one-up each other, the two browsers introduced new elements and new ways of manipulating web documents; this escalated to the point where their respective 4.0 versions were largely incompatible.</p>
<p>Realizing that this fragmentation would inevitably drive up the cost of building websites and ran the risk of denying users access to content and services they needed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Davis_(web_design)">Glenn Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.interactionbydesign.com/">George Olsen</a>, and <a href="http://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> co-founded WaSP and rallied <a href="http://archive.webstandards.org/members.html">an amazing group of web designers and developers</a> to help them push back. The WaSP’s <a href="http://archive.webstandards.org/mission.html">primary goal</a> was getting browser makers to support the standards set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
<p>In 2001, with the browser wars largely over, WaSP began to shift its focus. While some members continued to work with browser vendors on improving their standards support, others began working closely with software makers like Macromedia to improve the quality of code being authored in tools such as Dreamweaver. And others began the hard slog of educating web designers and developers about the importance of using web standards, culminating in the creation of <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/index.html">WaSP InterAct</a>, a web curriculum framework which is <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/">now overseen by the W3C</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of countless WaSP members and supporters (like you), Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the web as an open, accessible, and universal community is largely the reality. While there is still work to be done, the sting of the WaSP is no longer necessary. And so it is time for us to close down The Web Standards Project.</p>
<p>Many (if not all) of us are continuing to work in the world of web standards, but our work is now largely outside the umbrella of WaSP. If you are interested in continuing to work on web standards-related projects along with us, we humbly suggest you follow these projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> &#8211; The magazine “for people who make websites” is run by WaSP founder Jeffrey Zeldman and is a consistent source of forward-thinking articles and tutorials.</li>
<li><a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5 Doctor</a> &#8211; A solid resource and discussion forum on all things HTML5, brought to you by Bruce Lawson and his team.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/">W3C Community Groups</a> &#8211; If you have a passion for a specific web technology, you can help make it better by participating in one (or more) community groups. In particular, you might be interested in one of these: <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/">Core Mobile Web Platform</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">Responsive Images</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/">Web Education</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/texttracks/">Web Media Text Tracks</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://webplatform.org/">WebPlatform.org</a> &#8211; A fantastic web standards resource, providing up-to-date documentation, Q&#038;As, tutorials &#038; more. Chris Mills, Doug Schepers, and a number of other standards advocates are involved in this project.</li>
<li><a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com/">Web Standards Sherpa</a> &#8211; An educational resource founded by WaSP which continues to operate under the leadership of Chris Casciano,  Virginia DeBolt, Aaron Gustafson, and Emily Lewis.</li>
<li><a href="http://biz.webstandards.org/index.html">Web Standards + Small Business</a> &#8211; An outreach project started by WaSP that educates small businesses about why they should care about web standards. This project is overseen by Aaron Gustafson.</li>
</ul>
<p>The job&#8217;s not over, but instead of being the work of a small activist group, it&#8217;s a job for tens of thousands of developers who care about ensuring that the web remains a free, open, interoperable, and accessible competitor to native apps and closed eco-systems. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> job now, and we look forward to working with you, and wish you much success.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene: In the near future, we will be making a permanent, static archive of webstandards.org and some of our other resources like WaSP Interact to preserve them as a resource and to provide a record of our 15-year mission to improve the web.</em><br />

												<p>It&#8217;s been a great honor to be part of this team. It&#8217;s a great feeling to know that browser vendors, large companies and developers alike all recognize the necessity of standards. (Now if we could just get mobile on board. ;))</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to encourage everyone to get involved in one of the great projects Aarron mentions above — or to start your own open source project that fills in some of the other gaps. Let&#8217;s keep moving the web onward and upward.</p>

												<p>Thanks for all you&#8217;ve done, and continue to do through the sites listed above. As a web dev student, your work is invaluable to me. With the plethora of new libraries and the blend of languages that come across Twitter daily, it&#8217;s a must to have some centrally organized standards effort. </p>
<p>The college I attend is at the top of the heap in the world of web development programs, but they&#8217;re woefully out of date with their curriculum. This makes the work of web standards organizations that much more important.</p>

												<p>Umm&#8230; your work isn&#8217;t quite finished yet—Adobe Flash still exists and is making a mockery of the Web.</p>
<p>While Flash is a completely different and proprietary technology with a different utility and purpose to the Web standards which Flash relies on for Web delivery, it is the only remaining reason why accessibility of content continues to be an enormous problem for users.  The presence versus absence of Flash on a user&#8217;s preferred platform is what remains the sole contributor to problems relating to information access, excessive consumption of bandwidth and processing resources, and the security of both.</p>
<p>The extraordinary work of the Web Standards Project is still under threat of being undermined thanks to the continued deployment of Adobe Flash Player as an inefficient mechanism for delivering information to users where the use of standards laid out by the World Wide Web Consortium could have been used instead.</p>

												<p>Thanks for all the work you have done to keep the web free and open and standards compliant. But I must disagree with you that the fight is over and that the sites like this are not needed anymore. Increasingly old-fashioned corporations (like Microsoft and Apple) try to close down the web. Mostly by trying to sneak in all kinds of restrictions like HTML5 videos that are trapped in closed, non-free and patent-restricted video formats, instead of making it part of the standard to use only truly free and open formats like Off Theora or WebM. Then there are increasing pressure from those same companies to sneak in DRM (digital restrictions management) into web standards. And there are other tendencies like that which are increasing these days. So I think the fight is still on and free and open web still needs much defending and education of web developers which are unfortunately far from being aware of these threats to free and open internet. So yes, maybe your original goals don&#8217;t need to be worked on but there come new threats that still need much work.</p>

												<p>Webstandards.org has a while to go if it is to convince Web developers to adopt the very HTML5 and CSS3 standards that they have been fighting for, which are currently being overshadowed by the use of Adobe Flash and other technologies as unnecessary and obstructive replacements.</p>
<p>This is not a case of incompatible browsers anymore.  This is a case of Web developers using the right tools for the job&#8230; a case of technology awareness.  Adobe Flash is currently the leading cause of information inaccessibility, poor system utilisation, and at times, security, and most often, Flash is being used in places where HTML, CSS and JavaScript could be used for exactly the same tasks purposes with better results.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m saddened to see this project close and more-so because in your farewell above you fail to comment on your biggest contribution to stability of the web: ACID compliance testing for browsers.  The backbone of any standard is compliance testing (e.g. see Postscript, OpenGL, etc etc.) and while the W3C has an admirable suite of data validators, it has never shown any interest in presentation-layer validation or compliance testing.  Your ACID tests literally changed the world.  Suddenly, browsers had an objective benchmark against which they could measure presentation-layer standards compliance.  No one did that before WaSP and no one has done it since.  Perhaps the best site to follow your lead is <a href="http://browserscope.org/" rel="nofollow">http://browserscope.org</a>, however it simply packages the tests that you innovated.  IMHO, your work is far from done.  Who will lead presentation-layer compliance testing once you are gone?</p>

												<p>Well, I&#8217;d like to add a massive thank you to everyone who worked on and with and in the WaSP. The pressure developers to stick to the standard, and make everyone&#8217;s cake larger (rather than frying to get all of the cake &#8212; when it is needed is essential.   Great to see such confidence that interop will be the name of the game in the medium future.</p>
<p>Of course &#8212; there re other things to watch, including the power of massive governments, massive corporations, not to mention the &#8220;government-industrial complex&#8221;.   So lets all keep an eye out for misbehavior, such as, blocking and spying on the net.  There is much to keep track of, and I know that you all will be ready to come together in some form or other whenever the time calls for it.</p>
<p>Thank you for starting WaSP and running it.  The world is a better place as a result.</p>
