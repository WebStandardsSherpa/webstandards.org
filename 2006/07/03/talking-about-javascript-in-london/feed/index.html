		<description>You won&#039;t find the problems in JavaScript.
The Problem is the implementation of DOM in the Browser, not JavaScript itself.
Here is a simple example:
To access an element in the DOM, the programmer would type , &quot; document.getElementById(&quot;elementID&quot;) &quot;. This is an improvement over most web browsers implementations of DOM element access. Internet Explorer, before coming into DOM compliance, necessitated that the developer access the DOM via an array of all elements as such , &quot;document.all.[elementName] &quot;. Whereas this was handy, it did not comply with the DOM syntax aforementioned. The Gecko Engine, seen in Firefox and all of it&#039;s derivatives, has been W3C compliant for quite a while.</description>

		<description>To me the comments from Chris Wilson on implications of IE7 for web designers are very interesting. I just implemented an AJAX-driven application (meta search for hotel and flight  bookings) using layers etc. and the difference from IE6 to IE7 was *big*. IE7 does better in CSS standars now, but unfortunately it is as incompatible to FF and Opera as IE6. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Microsoft&#039;s fault, but for web designers it is now even worse - we have to support IE6, IE7, FF15, FF20, Opera8, Opera9....

		<description>I think it was Simon posted his (very good by the way), many of sites &amp; applications probably only require a few core things - dom manipulation, proper event binding, a little AJAX and a maybe couple of spiffy show/hide effects for polish.</description>
