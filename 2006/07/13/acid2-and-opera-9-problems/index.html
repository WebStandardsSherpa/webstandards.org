												<p>I found a difference in Opera 9 (Windows 2000) depending on whether Fit to Width is ON or OFF (it seems to me that by default, this setting is on in Opera 9).</p>

<p>It seems to have something to do with the screen width. The page it looks fine at the first load. If I then resize the page I get the &#8220;hat&#8221; like Bryan Rieger showed above. A reload fixes it.</p>

												<p>Resizing the browser window (or adjusting the zoom level in the page) causes &#8220;corruption&#8221; because the &#8220;Standards compliant?&#8221; text at the top of the page wraps (or unwraps) depending on the width of the browser window, causing part of the text object to move accordingly, but some of the objects do not (&#8220;the hat&#8221;).</p>

												<p>Thinking about it more, the &#8220;hat problem&#8221; is by design.  Part of the test includes absolutely positioned elements that exist in the same place on the browser viewport no matter how far the page has scrolled.  Those absolutely positioned elements are hidden under the &#8220;Standards compliant?&#8221; box at the top of the page.  The &#8220;Take the Acid2 test&#8221; link simply scrolls the page down so that the absolutely positioned elements are perfectly aligned with the rest of the test elements.  Changing the &#8220;height&#8221; of the document content (by adjusting the page width as described above) causes the absolute positioning to no longer work.</p>
<p>Perhaps a simple &#8220;fix&#8221; (if even deemed important)  is to prevent the text in the &#8220;Standard Compliant?&#8221; box at the top from wrapping, or make it an image, or whatever.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all assuming that this is the problem Molly is asking about. :-)</p>

												<p>Justin Thorp:</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a zoom bug in Opera 9.  It appears you have the zoom setting at 90%, which causes Opera to improperly render the Acid2 test.  Set the zoom setting to 100% (View menu : Zoom : 100%) then refresh the page and it should look normal.</p>

												<p>I experience two odd bars, however this only occurs after I scrolll&#8230;..should I even be able to scroll? The little smiley guy moves down, and the bars stay in place. This didn&#8217;t happen in Konquerer. After a refresh, the page moves back to the normal location (but I can still scroll and reproduce it again).<br />

												<p>Nope, you cannot scroll, cannot resize your window or text (except perhaps in certain particular magic jumps), cannot set a minimum font-size at anything like someone who needs it would use, or the test will not render  &#8220;correctly&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way it was written. (After all, there aren&#8217;t that many people who are going to try and read the content of the test right? It&#8217;s just to see if it works or not&#8230;)</p>

												<p>Looks fine, except if I resize or change text size. It works again however when clicking the url bar and pressing enter (ask Opera to scroll to top again).<br />
However after doing this a few times strange red lines appear.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, Opera doesn&#8217;t pass. You have to do more then just rendering fine just after loading!<br />
The css of web pages shouldn&#8217;t break after a resize!<br />
And don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s just the acid test. My web site also breaks in Opera after a resize. (In Opera 8, this issue is fixed in Opera 9.)</p>
<p>You should probably do like Firefox. Show the starting screen with the &#8220;Take The Acid2 Test&#8221; box again after a resize.</p>

												<p>Several of you mention problems when you zoom, resize, scroll, etc. These are all expected, and are NOT part of the test. The test itself is not designed to pass except under default setups. I will repeat the points from my article:, since some of you (such as Frederik) need to read this before posting screenshots or commenting.</p>
<p>* The forehead is a fixed position element. It will stay still when you scroll. That is correct behaviour. The test only works when it is at the default position after clicking the link. That is the correct response.</p>
<p>* The test may not pass if you make your minimum font size too big, or if you zoom, etc. The test itself is intentionally designed to only work assuming a &#8216;normal&#8217; setup, so this is expected behaviour. Complain to the authors if you do not like it :)</p>
<p>* Resizing the window may cause text at the top to wrap, and scroll the page a little, so you will need to click the link again &#8211; see note 2.</p>
<p>* Making the window very narrow will make parts of the test become too narrow (such as the chin) &#8211; this is because they use the table layout algorithm, and again, this is expected behaviour.</p>
<p>* The test will not work if you enable small screen rendering or Fit To Width (with a narrow window). That is intentional behaviour.</p>
<p>If you need more information about this, please see the whole article:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/acid/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/acid/</a></p>
<p>Note that it will also not work if you disable images, CSS, run user JavaScripts that alter it, or any number of other things (zoom, in particlular, will show odd responses as it has to compute scaled sizes that often end up being less than a pixel &#8211; so the hash images may not scale perfectly, and odd patches of colour may appear as a result).</p>
<p>If you have changed any of these things, then your screenshot is useless. Undo your changes, and try again. If it still goes wrong, then perhaps you have found a real problem.</p>

												<p>@Fredrik, what does View Source have to do with Acid 2? Please stop slandering Opera, if you don&#8217;t understand the way the test works. It does *not* say the display should be unaffected by scrolling, zooming, resizing, etc. Read the link Andrew gave, and the explanation given by Chaals!</p>
<p>&#8220;Do like Firefox&#8221; currently means not passing the test, doesn&#8217;t sound like a swell idea&#8230;</p>
<p>@Rolf: please use Opera 9 ginal to do the test, not a preview version&#8230;</p>
<p>Molly, what was the purpose of this thread? It is no secret that the test &#8216;fails&#8217; (in all browsers) after zooming (if thre browser supports full pagezoom), resizing, scrolling etc. Please consult with Hixie if you think there are problems.</p>

												<p>@Rijk: The View Source has nothing to do with the acid2 test. I just thought I&#8217;d say that so someone could correct it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, Opera 9 passes the acid2 test. I would say congratulations, but I already did when it became known that it passed the test.</p>
<p>But you should also look beyond the test. Just passing the test doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re standards-compliant.</p>
<p>The issue of the test breaking when you resize the window, is because of what I experience as a usability problem (probably has nothing to do with standards, but it is annoying). When you resize a window, you scroll to somewhere else. It happens on pages where the width of the text is relative (80%, but also the standard 100%). If you&#8217;re in the middle of reading a long document, and after resizing, you have to find out where you were, that&#8217;s quite annoying. Of course this happens in all browsers up to today. (I know why this happens, still it can be fixed.)</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to say, that altough you did a great job at passing the test, your browser still isn&#8217;t perfect, but keep going like this, and it soon will be!</p>

<p>Allow me to repeat myself :)</p>
<p>&#8220;zoom, in particlular, will show odd responses as it has to compute scaled sizes that often end up being less than a pixel &#8211; so the hash images may not scale perfectly, and odd patches of colour may appear as a result&#8221;</p>
<p>That explains the red grain around the eyes. Zooming to 50% usually (but not always) works.</p>
<p>Zooming also changes the size of the text at the top, and therefore changes how it wraps. In doing so, it changes how the page is scrolled, and makes those two black+red and black+yellow fixed position elements to become offset from the rest of the face.</p>
<p>The test is not designed to be zoomed, and if you do zoom, you invalidate the test. The test must only be used at 100% scale &#8211; that is the way it was designed to be used.</p>

<p>Sounds like your minimum font size it set too high &#8211; probably set to 13px. That is another thing that invalidates the test. If you set it to its default value of 9px, it should work.</p>
<p>Tools &#8211; Preferences &#8211; Advanced &#8211; Fonts &#8211; Minimum font size (pixels) = 9</p>
<p>If not, I will need to see a screenshot to work out what you have changed that causes it to fail.</p>

<p>How?  Acid2 isn&#8217;t meant for human consumption, it&#8217;s meant to test a browser&#8217;s capabilities.  Acid2 no more needs to be accessible than an XML fragment intended for data exchange.</p>
<p>I think what&#8217;s getting lost in this discussion is that displaying the pixel-perfect happy face isn&#8217;t the point of the test.  It&#8217;s an <strong>indicator</strong>, which should appear pixel-perfect under default conditions (mostly listed in the <a href="/action/acid2/guide/index.html" rel="nofollow">guide</a>, except that it doesn&#8217;t describe &#8220;common values&#8221; for the &#8220;default stylesheet&#8221;) that the browser handles a set of features and errors in the correct fashion.  Change those conditions, and the rendering will change as well.</p>
<p>A minimum font size is a user setting that overrides the author&#8217;s design.  It&#8217;s the equivalent of using a user stylesheet.  I can put all kinds of things in a user stylesheet that prevent the test page from showing the happy face, but that doesn&#8217;t change whether Opera handles data: URLs correctly, or fixed positioning, or transparent borders, or invalid CSS properties, or any of the other items being tested.</p>

												<p>Renders fine for me &#8211; tried Opera 9.0 (build 8501) on both WinXP and Win2k.</p>
<p>Yes, it does &#8220;break&#8221; if I scroll or zoom but I was never under the impression that the Acid2 test was supposed to scroll or zoom. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell from the Acid2 guide, the successful rendering means it passes the test. Zoom is supposed to be 100% and the scalp is *meant* to stay where it is. The red artefacts thing is irrelevant as you have to go outside the test to produce it. Just my take on it, some of the wording is ambiguous under this level of scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8230;and we should all take a deep breath! :)</p>

Nope &#8211; I did exactly the same on both systems. Can a firewall have any affect? I have a hard-wired one on my ADSL modem at home &#8211; work has restrictions on things like flash and maybe other things. Perhaps that is limiting some of the commands &#8211; I am not familiar with the coding</p>

												<p>[...] WaSP posted an entry asking readers if they encounter any problems while rendering the Acid2 test page with Opera 9. Yes, I do encounter problems while resizing the browser and more problems when zooming in and out. The smiley face rendition became disjointed and sometimes, a refresh would fix it. [...]</p>

<p>On first access, the line on which the &#8220;eyes&#8221; were supposed to show up had a red-tinged bar going from the beginning of where the left eye should be to the right edge of the face.  Refresh fixed it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed similar issues on a lot of pages with Opera 9.  Some pages render completely blank when refreshing my session on program startup, others have minor rendering problems.  Both can be remedied through refreshing the respective pages.</p>

												<p>One final test was to use the lap top at work &#8211; exactly the same setup as at home except using a proxy server connection to allow external web access at work (this is not necessary on the ADSL at home). The test failed &#8211; giving the same errors as the work desk top. Conclusion &#8211; the work network is affecting the results in some way. Does this happen for others? Some clever people out there must have and idea of why this is &#8211; it does not appear to be a fault of Opera.</p>

												<p>The Acid2 test should probably have been designed so that people with visual disabilities could still run the test effectively themselves. Given that it is about rendering, it is very hard to ensure that this will always be the case. And it is always possible to do an automatic comparison based on checking actual images without seeing the thing at all.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s part of history and learning. Maybe Acid3 will be different, but who knows.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m having an issue which might be related to this and i&#8217;m hoping someone can advise&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a really strange rendering issue in Opera 9. My site renders fine in every other browser but Opera 9. For some reason when I view a page that requires a vertical scroll bar the page shifts its position down by a 100 pixels or so but when I hit refresh the page renders in the correct position.</p>
<p>You can see the page <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yj7hlf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you resize the browser window the page will jump down, then refresh and it moves back up again.</p>
<p>Is this related to the acid2 test?</p>
