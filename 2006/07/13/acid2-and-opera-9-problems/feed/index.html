		<description>I&#039;m having an issue which might be related to this and i&#039;m hoping someone can advise...

I have a really strange rendering issue in Opera 9. My site renders fine in every other browser but Opera 9. For some reason when I view a page that requires a vertical scroll bar the page shifts its position down by a 100 pixels or so but when I hit refresh the page renders in the correct position.

You can see the page &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yj7hlf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you resize the browser window the page will jump down, then refresh and it moves back up again.

Is this related to the acid2 test?</description>

		<description>The Acid2 test should probably have been designed so that people with visual disabilities could still run the test effectively themselves. Given that it is about rendering, it is very hard to ensure that this will always be the case. And it is always possible to do an automatic comparison based on checking actual images without seeing the thing at all.

But that&#039;s part of history and learning. Maybe Acid3 will be different, but who knows.</description>

		<description>One final test was to use the lap top at work - exactly the same setup as at home except using a proxy server connection to allow external web access at work (this is not necessary on the ADSL at home). The test failed - giving the same errors as the work desk top. Conclusion - the work network is affecting the results in some way. Does this happen for others? Some clever people out there must have and idea of why this is - it does not appear to be a fault of Opera.</description>

		<description>Opera 9.00 release, build 8501
WinXP SP2
1024x768x32b

On first access, the line on which the &quot;eyes&quot; were supposed to show up had a red-tinged bar going from the beginning of where the left eye should be to the right edge of the face.  Refresh fixed it.

I&#039;ve noticed similar issues on a lot of pages with Opera 9.  Some pages render completely blank when refreshing my session on program startup, others have minor rendering problems.  Both can be remedied through refreshing the respective pages.</description>

		<description>[...] WaSP posted an entry asking readers if they encounter any problems while rendering the Acid2 test page with Opera 9. Yes, I do encounter problems while resizing the browser and more problems when zooming in and out. The smiley face rendition became disjointed and sometimes, a refresh would fix it.

		<description>Tarquin
Nope - I did exactly the same on both systems. Can a firewall have any affect? I have a hard-wired one on my ADSL modem at home - work has restrictions on things like flash and maybe other things. Perhaps that is limiting some of the commands - I am not familiar with the coding</description>

		<description>@Bob

Sounds like you have disabled images or possibly changed the zoom. (And again, doing either of these invalidates the test).</description>
