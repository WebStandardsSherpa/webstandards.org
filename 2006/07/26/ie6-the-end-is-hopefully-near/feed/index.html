		<description>Finally, an IE related article I agree with.

While, agreeably, it is nowhere near Opera (lets be honest Firefox is still lacking in the standards department) it is better than IE6 and for that I am excited.</description>

		<description>I have to say I&#039;m rather doubtful about the corporate adoption of IE7. Other companies may not be so bad, but my company&#039;s intranet is seemingly dependent on IE6&#039;s &#039;bodges&#039; (such as its use of padding) to get pages to view properly. In fact, trying to view intranet pages in a decent browser like Firefox is often just wasting your time. Short of a complete overhaul of the entire corporate network (I work for a very popular insurance group, so it&#039;s quite big) I can&#039;t see the switch taking place. 

I find it amusing that the company&#039;s IT department have numerous guidelines on how to make external web pages &#039;forward-compatible&#039; but didn&#039;t think to apply the same logic to their intranet.</description>

		<description>Has there been any word on a version of IE that will let you view a site in IE 6 &amp; IE 7? I know MS was working on the issue or at least discussing it. I would really like to avoid separate installs, and have an official version that allows this for developers.</description>

		<description>Although I&#039;m not a professional web designer, I always tend to use only valid XHTML Strict and CSS in my sites. Despite this IE browsers show very rarely the expected result especially when it&#039;s about positioning divs.
I hardly have troubles with Gecko browsers - they are quite accurate and follow the standards very well. Divs within divs within divs work fine with Firefox and make designing easier and more flexible.

Therefore I really want Mozilla to own 99% market share - though unfortunately it&#039;s very unlikely. In my opinion the biggest obstacles of spreading Firefox are that 1. most of the users don&#039;t even know about it and 2. a good deal of users is unable to install softwares on their computer because of security restrictions (I mean schools, offices, net cafes, etc). Personally I have a small rar archive on my ftp site containing Firefox executables and alway simply download and unrar it into a temp directory if I want to use it somewhere. I guess it would be a good idea to release such a pack officially so that more users could use the program.</description>

		<description>It sure would save a lot of hard work and research if we only had to write HTML/CSS for one standard.

I hover around XHTML 1.0 Transitional support which works well enough in IE, FF and Safari. If I have to lean in any direction its going to be with the company that has 85% market share. On some of my sites I see closer to 95%. 

I use tables for layout if I have to because I can do it quicker than trying to float divs within divs within divs. I have seen some pure CSS &quot;tricks&quot; to emulate layout and its not very maintainable.

I think the W3C would like everyone to create web pages that look like a paragraphs of text with the occasional bit of bold text to add flare.

Yawn. The whole evil empire argument is getting a bit, don&#039;t you think. 

Yep standards are good. Yep, Mic has written some crap software in their day, but would you really want mozilla to own 85% market share? Or how about thousands of companies each with their own browser. 

Sorry. I hope IE7 and IE8 develop into the perfect web browser and become the &quot;only&quot; web browser. That means less work for me.

Cheers (Don&#039;t take me too seriously)</description>

		<description>This doesn&#039;t mean the demise of IE6 but the demise of IE5. If my customers want that browser supported then they&#039;re going to have to pay extra for it.
Some say that those that dabble in web standards should support all current browsers, well at least anything above 0.5%. This is of course complete gobble-a-duke.
A client pays me for a site of certain quality and compliance. I have a base rate for a basic level of work. Want more? Than that will cost an X amount extra, thank you very much.

IE6 will be marginalised quicker than many think and that will mean that web standards can be pushed to a higher level. Automatic updates are good. If MS keeps going at this rate than Mozilla will be playing catch up with IE and not only with Opera and Safari.

The user wins.</description>
