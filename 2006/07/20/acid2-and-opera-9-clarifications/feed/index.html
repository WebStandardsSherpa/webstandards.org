		<description>Jack, Konqueror passed ACID2 because Apple has to send patches upstream due to the GPLv2.  They fullfil their legal obligation, and are responsible specifically for furthering CSS standards adherence.  Apple doesn&#039;t use KDE&#039;s Subversion or CVS, so the extra features they do add are a little harder to remerge, especially given the fact that Cocoa/Obj-C is almost exclusively permeated throughout Mac OS X, while QT is cheifly C++.  WebCore however cross pollinates both business model driven communities.  Firefox 2 does not pass ACID2, and its UI toolkit still non-native on all platforms.  Mozilla, IE6, IE7, Netscape and pre-Opera 9 don&#039;t pass ACID2 either.  Now if JavaScript standards existed and were enforced, currently I have to use Firefox more often since it has all the developer addons, which make debugging crazy AJAX scripts easier on it.</description>

		<description>Konqueror has passed the test since version 3.5. It was the second browser, after Apple&#039;s Safari, to pass the test.</description>

		<description>Will Firefox 3.0  pass the Acid2 browser test?

One of the things that has bothered Firefox&#039;s creators has been it&#039;s inability to pass the Acid2 browser test. A recent alpha release of Firefox 3.0 has been able to pass thanks to changes in it&#039;s rendering engine. Now Firefox can pass it will join the likes of Safari and Opera in being able to say it is truely (or at least as near as possible) standards compliant. And, of course this puts them another step ahead of Microsoft with Internet Explorer.</description>

		<description>[...] Parece ser que la versión de día 7 de Diciembre de 2006 de lo que será el nuevo Firefox ha pasado el Acid2 test, esto se debe a la nueva versión de Gecko (la 1.9) que pasará a ser el nuevo corazón de Firefox.&#160; Aunque otro navegadores como Opera 9 tambien lo pasó este verano, esto es una gran noticia.

		<description>When I use the latest Opera 9, the Acid face looks fine until I change the screen size from maximum to... anything else... whereof the top of it&#039;s head breaks off, looking a bit like he has a hat hovering over his head... does this means something is wrong, because it looks wrong?</description>

		<description>What you reference to as a bug is not really a bug. This effect you get is due to fixed positioning. If you go back and click on the test again it will show correctly. Because there is no scrolling provided on the page you cannot go to the exactly the same spot on the page. Two blocks that &quot;mess up&quot; the test as you have put it have style set position:fixed and the keep position relative to the vieport not the document. When you resize the window opera seems to scroll document a bit (possibly to show as much of the anchor as possible or center it on the screen) and that messes up the looks. If you dont believe me measure the distance between the top egde of the viewport and the eyes (in the picture) - it will change as you resize the window.</description>

		<description>I dont understand. When I use Opera and resize the window manually (grabing the corner and resizing) it messes up the test. 

So i guess Opera does not really pass then eh?</description>
