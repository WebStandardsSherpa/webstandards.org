		<description>Good question Gary. 

For those of you who don&#039;t know, the web standards organization (www.webstandards.org) has an acid 2 test that grades a browser&#039;s ability to render the most complicated CSS code. 

To answer your question Gary, it does not pass the Acid 2 test.

The test will remain extremely difficult (if not impossible) for Firefox to pass until they upgrade or move beyond the Gecko engine. It&#039;s easier to introduce a form spell checker...

I didn&#039;t download Explorer 7.0, but I&#039;m sincerely doubting it can render the drawing. The Trident engine is absolutely appalling.

		<description>... the page rendering in the new version is much faster now (Mac OS Tiger). You notice while scrolling down a page!

Are already using Cairo (http://cairographics.org/) for rendering??</description>

		<description>&quot;(writing on it right now actually). The spell checking is convieniant&quot;

-- but maybe not terribly effective? Sorry, couldn&#039;t resist.</description>

		<description>Jeff: Yes, URL&#039;s can actually have @ symbols in them. Here&#039;s an example for providing some basic authentication credentials:

http://username:password@example.com/</description>

		<description>I would like to &quot;find&quot; someplace where I can suggest that the Standards for rendering URL execution in the Browser treats all URLs that contain an @ symbol as a Email link, vs. a URL.

I am constantly running across misformed email links which leave out the &quot;mailto: portion, and get rendered as URLs.

Logic tells me that if a URL &#039;reads&#039; with the @ symbol in it, that there should be a way to trigger it as a email link vs. a URL website address? By default in the browser programming?

(It would default and detect when the&quot;mailto:&quot; portion of the link is left out if the @ symbol is present.)

This of course assumes the the @ symbol is not used in any actual URL address anywhere</description>

		<description>Support for Javascript 1.7 should definitely be interesting. I was also rather impressed with the form spellchecking feature - nice touch of innovation!</description>
