		<description>The true answer is that Mozilla sends us regular press updates and I happened to be available to blog that news on that day.</description>

		<description>Fyrd and Peter, I think this announcement was made due to the high usage of Firefox.  It is the second most used browser behind IE, all others probably being negligible from a practical viewpoint.  The surge in Firefox usage is significant from a standards viewpoint, so its updates and usage increases are relevant things to report here.  The more standards-compliant browsers, the better.  But not everyone interested necessarily uses it (I don&#039;t but I&#039;m still glad MS is being challenged).</description>

		<description>It&#039;s odd alright, especially considering that since Firefox 1.5, the automatic update actually works and updates the browser without you having to do anything. Are you guys going to announce the release of Firefox 1.5.0.6 today? :)</description>

		<description>I think the automated update is already released since I&#039;ve gotten mine 1-2 days ago.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m curious as to why the WASP announces the smallest Firefox updates when they are released, yet when Opera 9 was officially released there was not a single post about it.

Nothing against Firefox, but it seems a little odd.</description>
