		<description>The line of the day goes like this, &quot;Hello Mr customer, why don&#039;t you _upgrade_ to firefox..you see for one it actually works, two it&#039;s free and three is supports SVG&quot; 

Opera or Firefox!!

and one more thing, no more branch coding, am sick of branch coding, from now on it&#039;s just tough, W3C standards and nothing else.

Maybe we need a standards group for implementing the standards from the standards group.</description>

		<description>Who needs ActiveX Opt-in when developers have to spend many valuable hours and days on guessing what the IE team has implemented and what they have left out.

With the comments so far, it doesnt seem anything has changed.

Did they ever think of opening their own w3c...</description>

		<description>Jose, I think in the whole you are right, but still it has some new features as &quot;ActiveX Opt-in&quot; or Page Zoom.</description>

		<description>Even discussing IE is a waist of time. Every web developer knows how much time is waisted and how much functionality is comprimised to make feature rich web sites compatible with IE. It has no compliance to standards. A total &quot;up yours&quot; to anyone not using IE.

It&#039;s time to stop supporting browsers that does not comply to industry standards. VML and now XAML, when there is already mature standards such as SVG out there! It&#039;s just silly!</description>

		<description>Those are not important webstandards.
They are probably important to you.

and for SVG especially.
For MS it would probalby be wiser to support their own new scalable vector format XAML in the next generations of IE rather dan going for SVG. That format is the basis for their new Expression web design suite. 

Especially since their VML format which is incorporated in IE was rejected by W3C due to competitors launching another format which was not supported by any browser at that time. 
Adding XAML to IE before considering adding SVG support would be a big payback to those competitors that twarted the use of VML.</description>

		<description>Cant wait to see the comparative reviews of IE7, Firefox 1.5 or 2.0, Opera 8 or 9, Safari etc. &lt;strong&gt;See who has done the best job of implementing not just CSS and  pass ACID2, but also SVG, JavaScript E4X, MathML and other important Web standards&lt;/strong&gt;</description>
