		<description>[...] Spulen wir vor ins Jahr 2005. Der Safari 2.0.2 ist der erste Browser, der den harten Acid2-Test des Web Standards Project besteht. Kurz darauf folgen iCab (ein Mac-Browser des deutschen Entwicklers Alexander Clauss), Konqueror (ein ebenfalls auf KHTML basierender Linux-Browser) und später auch Opera in der Version 9. Damit war der dringend nötige Beweis erbracht: Webstandards funktionieren. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Yes, I am well aware that this is quite a lame and silly idea. I normally wouldn&#8217;t post something like this, but the other day I was out this guy was going on about how good Opera was and how it was the only browser that passed the acid2 test, which surprise, surprise, was developed in conjunction with Opera Software. And frankly I just didn&#8217;t like the guy; found him very conceited. [...]</description>

		<description>Err, an &quot;uild&quot; (in the last comment) is like a build but we have to do some more work on it before releasing it ;) And I meant to say that it doesn&#039;t work with zooming or moving anything else in any way...

You can see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediumgeek.com/node/view/292&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;screenshot of Acid2 on mobile&lt;/a&gt; though, thanks to our leaky developers. (Just kidding. Mediumgeek is a model of integrity, as well as a great developer).</description>

		<description>Hey, we have an internal phone uild that passes Acid2... but afraid you&#039;ll have to wait a little to get that on your own phone.

Sadly, the Acid2 test itself relies on things like people having a small minimum font size set or who have any kind of text zooming. So it would have been bad luck to people like me who often use both of those, but luckily I can set a site-specific preference in Opera 9 just so tha Acid2 test renders...

Hopefully Acid3 will be better designed to take account of various basic accessibility features - and maybe we could even hope designers follow it into using standards to make the web work better for everyone.</description>

		<description>If I could get opera on my phone that would be great! It may be worth making a premium feature - cell operators could advertise it in commercials and make it another bonus reason for getting a new phone...</description>

		<description>... I just downloaded the newest version of Opera, but the smiley is red behind the eyes...! At least it&#039;s the right shape. Zooming to 150 then to 50 then to 150 and back to 100 breaks the smiley into little fragments. 

Also Opera 9 seems to render pages a lot faster than v8.54, but for some reason it hangs for 2 seconds every minute or so.. there, typed a few letters in this box and no response, then the letters suddenly all appeared..</description>

		<description>@Bugmaster: according to Opera&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.opera.com/Windows/9.00/en/display.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; pages, &#039;fit to width&#039; is an option to reformat web pages to fit the available screen size — on a mobile phone, for example.

I can&#039;t say why Opera reformats the Acid2 page when there is already enough width to display the page as-is. But I&#039;m also not sure it&#039;s fair to expect the test to render properly when you&#039;ve selected an option that explicitly tells the browser to reformat the page. That seems kinda like selecting 16:9 aspect ratio on your TV and then wondering why a 3:4 TV show looks &#039;squished&#039;.</description>
