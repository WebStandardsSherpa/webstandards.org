		<description>Interesting title the Queens new clothes, I think Tim Hannigan gives a great presentation , and I think that web standards not only help out in search engines but also in being user friendly so people will want to come back ! Always glad to hear about someone else getting ti together and making there websites web standards compliant.</description>

		<description>Gordon -
we&#039;re currently working with your department on Lenya development.  On a highly decentralized campus like Queen&#039;s, initiatives such as the WCG reaching everybody take a bit of time.

Now that I have some folks to back me up in my standards drive, I think it&#039;s time for a department meeting...</description>
