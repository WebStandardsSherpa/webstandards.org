		<description>GREAT job, guys!  I LOVE the site!

Your letter to designers and visitors alike has motivated me to get on the stick and learn more about DOM scripting, etc.

Molly, if I can help with anything, please let me know.

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We’re putting users first — not just in this entry, but in this entire task force. We want to make sure that everyone has the tools that they need to consume and create Web content, and the education they need to do it well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bravo. Great statement which I&#039;m happy to hear about.</description>
