		<description>The whole functions are designs looks great, but on the navigation tip it’d be nice to have a simple link to the previous article…for people not on the RSS.</description>

		<description>[...] WaSP is back in full force with a fresh redesign, launched at SXSW. It has an interesting layout, even though I&#8217;m not a big fan of the colour scheme. I guess it will grow on me. The most obvious improvement though is the ability to leave comments on the site. This way it may become more of a rally point for the web standards community.

		<description>Are you EVER going to do anything about line lengths and text size?
You&#039;ve seen (I presume) these multiple comments about readability issues ... are you placated by the &quot;awww ain&#039;t it pretty&quot; comments and ignoring the complaints?
Give me readable line lengths, PLEASE.</description>

		<description>I like the new design, but I must agree with those who say the font size makes it difficult to read.  Having a base font size  of 72% is WAY too small.</description>

		<description>WaSP... black, yellow, white, oh I get it... er, no I don&#039;t, its a very an ugly colour combination. The large blocks of yellow and black are nowhere as easy to read as the previous design - bring it back pronto. 
WaSP do worthwhile advocacy work, but advocates have to sell their message - on the web they have to make themselves required reading - and I&#039;ll be a lot less likely to come back and read this site if I have to battle with this colour combo.
Now, how do I set up a user stylesheet?</description>

		<description>I am sorry to say that this design seems pretty dodgy to me. 
It certainly lacks the openness and charm of the previous design.
The huge black and yellow chunks lend a very aggressive and threatening touch to the site while font size is so tiny (10px here) making the site illegible without zooming. 
I wonder, when will people learn &lt;strong&gt;not to fiddle with default font size&lt;/strong&gt; set in the visitor’s browser’s preferences.
Illegible content due to tiny font sizes is still number 1 of Nielsen’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

You certainly could and should have done better.</description>

		<description>Nice redesign :-)

But I am not sure if I like it more than the previous WaSP design... It was cleaner somehow, simpler, and... now the present colors look strange on my 17&quot; trinitron monitor...

// Sidenote: Ingo, why text is unreadble on the Mac? Is it because Macs have 72 pixels-per-inch monitor resolution, and PCs have 96 - therefore, text becomes much smaller on the Mac?</description>

		<description>May I suggest 
to replace the black with #404040 
and the font-size: 72% with 100%

The text is unreadable for both reasons on my Mac.</description>
