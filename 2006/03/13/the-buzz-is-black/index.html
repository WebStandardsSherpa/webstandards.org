				<p>On March 13, 2006 at SxSW Interactive in Austin, Texas, WaSP unveils a redesigned site.</p>
				<a href="#content-sub" id="stmjrCollapse-content-summary" title="Skip to comment form">Skip to comment form</a>
			</div>

			<p>We&#8217;ve teased you for far too long, asked you to wait, to be patient. We&#8217;ve made promises you probably began to think we wouldn&#8217;t ever keep. Well, here&#8217;s our long awaited gift to you, the new WaSP redesign.</p>
<p>Many WaSPs have gathered in Austin, Texas at SXSW Interactive. For the past several years we&#8217;ve held our annual meeting at the event, mostly due to the fact that more WaSP members are found in one place during SXSW than any other time. </p>
<p>Last year during our meeting, which we held after hours in a public area within the conference center, Robert Scoble and Marc Canter came over and tried to engage us in a conversation. Having only an hour to get through WaSP business, I stung them both with a &#8220;sorry, we&#8217;re having a closed meeting.&#8221; </p>
<p>Aching from the sting, Scoble posted about the incident, which he felt showed WaSP in a bad light. Conversations via his blog ensued, which ultimately inspired the formation of the WaSP / Microsoft Task Force.</p>
<p>Within WaSP, discussions as to a site redesign and the opening up of comments and the WaSP itself to greater public participation continued. These discussions, combined with Scoble&#8217;s response, brought us to the realization that we wanted to take WaSP in new directions.</p>
<p>The results? This newly redesigned site fresh with comments and trackback support for your input as well as an open meeting for all attendees of SXSW to enjoy. It is on behalf of all of WaSP I invite you to take a look around and encourage you to participate in what we believe will be a new era of activity and success for the advancement of the Web standards movement.</p>

												<p>[...] The Web Standards Project (WaSP) website has undergone a major redesign. This reflects the new energy that has been pumped into the project since web browser development began to accelerate in the last year or so. The WaSP group has been working closely with the Internet Explorer development team to push for improved standards support in Internet Explorer 7 and future versions, with notable success. The new website also features a comment system and trackback support. [...]</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m really loving the redesign.<br />
The um, waspy colour scheme and the fat text looks great.<br />
but it&#8217;s the little things (like this hideable comment box) that make it work for me :)</p>
<p>An excellent step forward.  But it feels kinda weird commenting here.  Someone pinch me ;) !</p>

												<p>Well it looks nice enough, but I&#8217;m surprised that you are using white text on a yellow background.  For an accessibility site, that doesn&#8217;t seem very accessible.</p>

												<p>Congratulations on the design. I often get asked by juniors why so many web standard websites to them seem boring. It helps to be able to now hold this standing stone up as an example of how you can be both standard complient and also well designed. Being about to comment makes the community aspect of WASP apparent and I can see you are doing a lot to avoid the accusations of a closed club through open meetings and this new site. It is all good and makes me feel the tide is turning with regards to standards. Perfect start to this part of the year.</p>

												<p>I like the redesign however I too am surprised about the white on yellow contrast but even more so at the yellow on yellow which can be found on you about page and other sub pages.</p>
<p>I would consider it to be quite an important statement as well&#8230;</p>

												<p>[...] WaSP is back in full force with a fresh redesign, launched at SXSW. It has an interesting layout, even though I&#8217;m not a big fan of the colour scheme. I guess it will grow on me. The most obvious improvement though is the ability to leave comments on the site. This way it may become more of a rally point for the web standards community. [...]</p>

												<p>It is good to see that the different workgroups are featured more prominently. It is also good to have a talk-back function here (and I&#8217;m hoping for interesting discussion here where we all learn from).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about the redesign though. I&#8217;m not talking look &amp; feel, but on the fornt page I have a very hard time distinguishing the white on black text on the left-hand side and the silvery colour of text in the white panel to the right of it.</p>
<p>The combination of contrasts make it very hard to read, combined with the rather small type.</p>
<p>Yes, I had my eyes checked recently and for a 35 year old I still have much of my &#8220;eagle sight&#8221;. I know about text-zoom, but Camino makes the type too large when I go one zoom up to have a comfortable read.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, this is one of the very few websites where I&#8217;m experience legibility problems. I do realize the mileage may vary for other readers, of course.</p>

												<p>Questions about the design:</p>
<p>1) Why is Search hidden? Even if it is not hidden, wouldn&#8217;t a screen reader read &#8220;search&#8221; twice because of the legend and then &#8220;Search WaSP&#8221;?</p>
<p>2) The branding uses the H1 tag, and with my experience with WordPress, this means every page will have the same H1. Given the experience that WaSP has via its members, shouldn&#8217;t H1 be moved from the branding to the title of the article?</p>
<p>I like the new design.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;d have to agree with the others that the white on yellow isn&#8217;t ideal, and I actually had problem seeing when my Mozilla had the sidebar open. Black(or very dark brown) on yellow would be a far better combination.</p>

												<p>Very nice update to the WASP site. :-)</p>
<p>Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict (though not attempting to serve as application/xhtml+xml&#8230;though I can understand as you guys just added a comments script so it gets ify there).</p>
<p>WAI AAA compliant according to Cynthia!</p>
<p>BUT&#8230;.</p>
<p>A minor but (I feel) important accessibility concern!</p>
<p>While there are not tabindex attributes (and using TAB seems to be ok from what I&#8217;ve seen so far) you should not rely on the browser to give a good enough visual queue for the user to see which anchor is currently focused. I would suggest adding the focus pseudo-element to your anchors with high contrasting colors that make it easy to spot which anchor is currently focused.  If you want an example try tabbing through WAI&#8217;s homepage.</p>

												<p>Ouch! The colors hurt my eyes too.</p>
<p>- The home page&#8217;s white on black letters is difficult to read with the white background to the right. I had to go to the article to read it.</p>
<p>- What&#8217;s with the teeny font in Firefox? IE seemed to be fine.</p>
<p>- Please add more white space for the left and right margins of an article. The line lengths are just to wide.</p>
<p>- I think (just my personal opinion) that the old font and its size were easier to read.</p>

												<p>I can hardly read it until I&#8217;ve gone a couple of zooms up in Firefox. What&#8217;s the problem with just not setting a font size at all so that the user gets whatever size they&#8217;ve set as their default (in my case 14px). I&#8217;m fed up with the majority of sites deciding they need to override my defaults simply because the designer thinks small text looks cool. Come on guys, you can do better than this.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m disappointed, I appreciate this is a big change, but I guess my expectations were high.<br />
Of course, you can tune it up some, but I think the white on yellow is a pretty poor choice, and the yellow itself is just too brown to be attractive.</p>
<p>The font-size issue can be corrected, but I&#8217;m surprised that it reads better in IE than FF at launch.</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t get why there&#8217;s a toggle for the subtitle/summary &#8211; surely, to quote 37signals, &#8220;it just doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221; &#8211; it hardly uses enough space to justify it.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say a toggle for the main text would be better &#8211; to reduce the scroll size, if you&#8217;ve got comments toggled open&#8230; Speaking of which, why toggle the comment form, and not the majority of the comments too?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just a bit baffled really, given who the WaSPs are&#8230;</p>

												<p>Sorry guys, I really love the site and I have been a regular bvisitor for years, but I really don&#8217;t like this redesign.<br />
It hasn&#8217;t got the professional simple look of the old design and it&#8217;s much more difficult to read.</p>

												<p>Hmmm, I&#8217;m a little surprised at the negative comments. When I first saw the redesign, I found it to be <em>very</em> striking and bold, with the use of yellow and black. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>The issues with text size do have merit. IE seems to like making text larger than Firefox, in which the text is a little small, but I&#8217;m pretty sure (&#8230;) the intended size is Firefox&#8217;s rendering. The text responds very nicely to resizing anyway. </p>
<p>To say that this iteration doesn&#8217;t have the &#8220;professional look&#8221; of the old design is preposterous. The old design was bland and lacked character, while this design definitely creates a stronger identity, which is most definitely very professional, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As for the toggles, they are a bit of overkill. I don&#8217;t really see the use of being able to hide the comment fields. As for the article description toggle, if people wrote longer descriptions for articles, it might be useful, but seeing as the description is basically a short summary, it doesn&#8217;t seem likely.</p>

												<p>I have 2 comments + suggestions regarding the webstandards.org redesign.</p>
<p>1- Dual text color and background color patterns<br />
==============================</p>
<p>There is 2 color patterns in the redesign. The left part of the page is white text on black background; the right part of the page is black text on white background.<br />
After reading a bit, my reading habits or eye vision kind of forget, ignore the left part (white on black background) because I&#8217;m not accustomed to read in this kind of color pattern. <strong>Newspapers, magazines, reviews, books are all black (or dark) text on white (or pale) background.</strong> </p>
<p>The problem with the 2 color patterns is NOT sufficient color contrast.</p>
<p>The problem with the page redesign is that there is not just 1 but 2 color patterns. <strong>So reading, eye vision can not coherently be adjusted, oriented toward both color patterns.</strong> I find this dual color pattern to be a mistake, an error on appreciating how people read, scan a page for reading.</p>
<p>At a less degree, I also find the color of links (yellow) sub-optimal&#8230; but at least, it&#8217;s hegemonuously the same on all page and in all parts of a page.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to implement alternate stylesheet supported with cookie. An user could then choose his preferred styling of webstandards.org webpages and work around &#8220;problems&#8221; he sees or perceived with a visual layout.<br />
Personally, I would most likely use the same previous layout because I am/was accustomed to it. </p>
<p>2- Related link are not coded or coded improperly<br />
===============================</p>
<p>When I visit a page in webstandards.org site, I should be able to click the &#8220;Top&#8221; link in my Mozilla Seamonkey 1.5a Site Navigation toolbar and then jump back to the entrance page, home page, index.html page of webstandards.org as explained by HTML 4.01 recommendation. But the linkage is not there. Same thing with Opera 9.0: I should be able to click the &#8220;Home&#8221; link in the Opera Site Navigation toolbar but it is not there.</p>

												<p>I really like the design; bold, bright and clear. The default font-size in firefox is a little small though that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

												<p>May I suggest<br />
to replace the black with #404040<br />
and the font-size: 72% with 100%</p>
<p>The text is unreadable for both reasons on my Mac.</p>

												<p>Nice redesign :-)</p>
<p>But I am not sure if I like it more than the previous WaSP design&#8230; It was cleaner somehow, simpler, and&#8230; now the present colors look strange on my 17&#8243; trinitron monitor&#8230;</p>
<p>// Sidenote: Ingo, why text is unreadble on the Mac? Is it because Macs have 72 pixels-per-inch monitor resolution, and PCs have 96 &#8211; therefore, text becomes much smaller on the Mac?</p>

												<p>I am sorry to say that this design seems pretty dodgy to me.<br />
It certainly lacks the openness and charm of the previous design.<br />
The huge black and yellow chunks lend a very aggressive and threatening touch to the site while font size is so tiny (10px here) making the site illegible without zooming.<br />
I wonder, when will people learn <strong>not to fiddle with default font size</strong> set in the visitor’s browser’s preferences.<br />
Illegible content due to tiny font sizes is still number 1 of Nielsen’s <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html" rel="nofollow">Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a>.</p>
<p>You certainly could and should have done better.</p>

												<p>WaSP&#8230; black, yellow, white, oh I get it&#8230; er, no I don&#8217;t, its a very an ugly colour combination. The large blocks of yellow and black are nowhere as easy to read as the previous design &#8211; bring it back pronto.<br />
WaSP do worthwhile advocacy work, but advocates have to sell their message &#8211; on the web they have to make themselves required reading &#8211; and I&#8217;ll be a lot less likely to come back and read this site if I have to battle with this colour combo.<br />
Now, how do I set up a user stylesheet?</p>

												<p>I like the new design, but I must agree with those who say the font size makes it difficult to read.  Having a base font size  of 72% is WAY too small.</p>

You&#8217;ve seen (I presume) these multiple comments about readability issues &#8230; are you placated by the &#8220;awww ain&#8217;t it pretty&#8221; comments and ignoring the complaints?<br />

												<p>[...] WaSP is back in full force with a fresh redesign, launched at SXSW. It has an interesting layout, even though I&#8217;m not a big fan of the colour scheme. I guess it will grow on me. The most obvious improvement though is the ability to leave comments on the site. This way it may become more of a rally point for the web standards community. [...]</p>
