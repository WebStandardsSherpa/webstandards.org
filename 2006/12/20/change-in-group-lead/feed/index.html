		<description>Best of luck to Kimberly and you (Drew) in leading the group in to the future.

I think WaSP actually gained a second lease of life under the wing of Molly, she&#039;s really helped it achieve great things over the past few years (the work with Microsoft stands out most in my mind) and I&#039;m sure she&#039;s thrilled to still be a key part of some of the WaSP task-forces.

Best Wishes, 
Matt</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;the Holz in my schlag&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That doesn&#039;t sound too pleasing :)

But I also want to thank Molly personally and publicly for the work she&#039;s done behind the scenes for the WaSP, and at the same time wish her the best of luck with her latest focus.</description>

		<description>Dear Molly,

I appreciated the leadership and personal dedicated efforts you have given the web standards movement over the years. 

On your blog, I see you&#039;ve been able to ask Bill Gates a question on web standards. Amazing! And he answered 

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.molly.com/2006/12/14/who-questions-bill-gates-commitment-to-web-standards/&quot;&gt;
&quot;(...) if you name some obscure thing and say hey, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft ought to do more on that&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll probably just send Dean [Hachamovitch] mail and say hey, she said that such and such a thing we should go and do and &lt;strong&gt;we’ll go and do it&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If I can help, I&#039;m still very much supporting the web standards movement and, in particular, the web standards group.

Thank you Molly and wishing you and your loved ones all the best in 2007,

		<description>Molly, you&#039;ve been an inspiration to us all including women.

Good luck Kimberley and Drew. I see this time, the leadership is shared by both sides of the gender and balance is good.

I&#039;d be rooting for all the guys and gals in WaSP, whether you&#039;re the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; man or a &quot;strong public relations&quot; woman :)</description>
