		<description>Perhaps the best JavaScript framework/library is &lt;a href=&quot;http://prototype.conio.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/a&gt;. Probably its only drawback is lack of great documentation. It isn&#039;t so much of a problem anymore, though.</description>

		<description>John Resig of jQuery has asked people &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/blog/2006/12/13/helping-you-understand-jquery/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on the jQuery blog&lt;/a&gt; to give examples of what tutorials are needed, and this is a great step ahead. 

As to the comments here, please stop advertising one or the other library and their code, this is not the point of this. Especially the last code example by jake is an exact violation of the idea that you should leave CSS to the CSS parser and you shouldn&#039;t create scripts that make functionality dependent on JavaScript. Just because you _can_ create a footer with JavaScript it doesn&#039;t make it a good idea.</description>

		<description>When I went to choose a library, I downloaded some pages and the entire library. Some were horrible, full of modifications to the dom and non-valid xhtml or almost as many lines of code as the low level calls. But I kept on reading. Then I found jquery. at first look I thought &#039;what language is this&#039;, &#039;it looks like some lambda influenced language, some son of a lisp.... upon further reading, I realized it&#039;s just javascript.... and I understood most of the ways it was done. The code is brief,  and the code you write is almost lyrical! 

Where else can I say something like this:

$(&quot;#footer&quot;)
		.width(&quot;100%&quot;)
		.addDir({dir:&quot;Pix/Friends/&quot;,width:30,randomize:true})
		.addDir({dir:&quot;Pix/HD/&quot;,width:50,randomize:true})
		.addDir({dir:&quot;Pix/Family/&quot;,width:30,randomize:true})

with one little function addDir that is only a dozen lines of code?

Where else can I ask a panel of experts about the simple and mundane or the complex and intricate  effects or ajax?

Amazing code + amazing people = success.</description>

		<description>Having tried most of the libraries on the market, (having sometimes to switch libraries mid-project - lack of good documentation) I understand the frustrations, very well, of the time and pain it takes to find a good one, so thank you guys from bringing this to print.

6 months ago I was deep in a conversion from prototype/scriptaculous to dojo (for an enterprise app) and found myself again scratching my head at the complexities, lack of solid cross browser support, and pure bloat of dojo. Thats when I found JQuery and after all 10 libraries or variations there of I have tried I will never go back and that is simple because of what this article is addressing. JQuery has a very different approach (the result of which is an easily manipulable DOM), they have loads of documentation (gotapi, as well as existing docs: visualjquery.com, etc), the community is strong, it&#039;s lightweight, and the effects, plugins, AJAX support are second to none.

Not that I want to plug one particular library but I think JQuery illustrates the solutions to the above points/problems better than the rest. Hopefully this article raises a bit of awareness to all of the soon to be lib developers out there that simply putting together another API is not what the development world needs now.</description>

		<description>I think most js libraries fail because of sparse or lack of documentation.  Documentation, for most, developers seems to be an after thought.  However, there are a few libraries that have really good documentation.  My favorite is jQuery (http://jquery.com).  They just recently posted their API doc on http://gotapi.com.  The nice thing about jQuery is that the documentation is built into the development process.  You can count on new releases being documented thoroughly.</description>

		<description>I should add that I just looked through SVN trunk for mootools as mentioned above. The download of this framework lets you select just the files you need. A step in the right direction but the string class (yes I said class - go see for yourself) contains only a couple of functions I can imagine using. The array class is more useful and the framework is interesting enough to check out.</description>

		<description>There are general problems with the idea of reusable javascript libraries; one is bloat. JS libs should ship with a preprocessor to generate include files that only contain code for the objects and functions in use.  

A good example of a javascript library is the google canvas lib for IE. I would hesitate to call it a library, it&#039;s more of a compatability shim and this is why js libraries are popular. Most web developers could throw a library together in a weekend, however we only want to write and debug our code once, not once for every browser.

As for client side &lt;em&gt;javascript frameworks&lt;/em&gt;, this a more recent and disturbing trend. Perhaps Tamarin will integrate AOT compilation with browser caching, making these things slightly less rediculous.</description>
