			<p>Well, it was actually 5 years ago this week, but I had The Beatles&#8217; Sgt Pepper in my head and decided to go with that instead. So sue me. </p>
<p>Anyway, it was 5 years ago this week that (WaSP member) <a href="../../../../about/members/drewm/index.html">Drew McLellan</a> documented his own Eureka moment of seeing the benefit of CSS-based layouts over tables in <a href="http://dreamweaverfever.com/soap/turningthetables/"><cite>Turning the Tables (or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Web Standards)</cite></a> and it was five years ago in February that Jeffrey Zeldman wrote about the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/journey/">transition from tables to CSS for A List Apart</a>. </p>
<p>Can you believe it? Five whole years, count &#8216;em. Some of the designers knocking out sexy CSS sites now were still in school wearing short trousers back then. Actually, scratch that &#8211; some of them still are. </p>
<p>In that time, I believe that most of the audience for this site and for A List Apart will have left table-based designs a long way behind and probably baulk at the thought of doing it this way. Ever again. But despite all our individual efforts, and the net effect that our efforts have on anyone that we also manage to inspire to do the same, there are still a lot of large corporations and small web design shops out there that continue to pump out table-based designs (something that even <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/#N11001">appears to get approval according to the current WCAG 2.0 draft</a>). Sure, we&#8217;ve come a long way (baby), but just who are the sinners who still continue to peddle such techniques? Who would you most like to see drinking from the CSS Kool Aid and getting their act together? And did I really just write &#8216;Kool Aid&#8217;?</p>

												<p>Teachers. Now, I haven&#8217;t experienced this personally, but from what I understand, there are still teachers teaching table layouts, spacer images, and probably every bad practice out there.</p>
<p>It can be expected. Teachers typically learn their stuff before they start teaching, and only the most dedicated teachers keep their skills up to the cutting edge. But I think there is a lot of room for improvement to ensure schools, colleges and universities teach only the best practices.</p>
<p>The last thing we need is a new generation of web professionals still doing things the wrong way.</p>

												<p>I know several teachers still teaching tables-based design. The template for my university&#8217;s &#8220;official&#8221; pages is based on tables. The amount of force required to overcome this inertia is often depressing. </p>
<p>At the Refresh Austin meeting last night, someone showed a page that was comprised entirely of graphics. The text was all images!</p>

												<p>One of the reasons I have not yet adopted CSS for layout is the problem of dealing with non-standard browsers. Every tutorial or book I look at has fixes for problems in certain browsers, and until I can be assured that I won&#8217;t run into this type of headache, on the balance for me CSS is not yet worth the hassle.</p>

												<p>Hey Derek,</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/" rel="nofollow">Layout Gala</a>. Works even on strange browsers and looks good on handheld devices. Use <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/" rel="nofollow">Faux Columns</a> to get full height columns without a lot of extra divs and you&#8217;re set. Smaller code, easier to change, better search and if you do it right accessible to those with disabilities. To quote a popular commercial, &#8220;just do it&#8221;.</p>

												<p>About teachers&#8230;<br />
When I was studying, we &#8220;learned&#8221; HTML and CSS with a rather old-school teacher.</p>
<blockquote><p>CSS is used to hide the underline on the links</p></blockquote>
<p>he told us.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s it.We are supposed to be become web specialist, and that&#8217;s what we learned&#8230;</p>
<p>(sorry for my poor english, I&#8217;m French)</p>

												<p><strong>@Derek:</strong> Tables work differently in different browsers as well. It&#8217;s just that people have spent enough years doing table-based development that hacking around them that it&#8217;s second-nature. If you&#8217;re waiting to use CSS until you magically know all the workarounds as though they were second-nature without having to scale the same learning curve we had with tables, you&#8217;ll be waiting a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>@Small Paul:</strong> Yup, most definitely. Vertical centering is one of my favourite examples. <em>Real</em> columns are another. Proportionally sized elements which adjust to fill a set width à la table cells (e.g. for a top nav bar) is a third. And don&#8217;t get me started about the impoverished wasteland that is fonts on the web. But again, the same is true for table-based layout.</p>

												<p>&#8220;CMS, e-learning, and other major vendors could really use some CSS Kool Aid.&#8221; &#8212; To follow what Andrea said in more specificity: <a href="http://blackboard.com/" rel="nofollow">Blackboard</a>.  (Oh, wow.  Their corporate site has gone all div-tastic since I last looked&#8230;but the actual product: frames (!) &amp; tables a-gogo.)</p>

												<p>I would love to see educators, professors and the like drink the CSS Kool Aid. That is, those that haven&#8217;t already, and I&#8217;m glad to see more and more of them do so these days.</p>
<p>Google. Another vote for seeing Google stop being such a jerk and get their act together. They don&#8217;t have to magically convert to valid markup and CSS or anything, but some basic semantics and the like would go a long way already.</p>
<p>The WAI. Yes, they know all about CSS and semantics and such already, but seriously, WCAG 2.0 is a horrid mess and it&#8217;s counter-productive to the entire Web Standards movement.</p>

												<p>I think that the majority of designers / developers would like to be taught correctly. Creating a site that is based upon <a href="http://www.w3c-standards.com/" rel="nofollow">W3C Standards</a> using XHTML and CSS is the only way to go ahead.</p>
<p>Sadly as you have written there are lots of people out there that are still using tables, frames etc. to create said sites. These are the people that should take a long look at what they are doing and then go back to school and start learning the new way.</p>
<p>It is very hard to get people to re-think their methods as they have been creating sites for many years and they work. So why the change? An easy simplified answer is Accessibility, Usability and a general clean-up.</p>

												<p>By using CSS I can separate the elements that define how the page is styled from those that define the content. It is these standards that have enabled me to build my Web site using CSS for all the layout.</p>

												<p>well, everything goes faster right know. and &#8220;old&#8221; webdesigner that already comfortable with table layout design still use it and do not want to change their design with something new (and ofcourse better..) like CSS, even CSS have lot of benefit. but do not worry, by the time, &#8220;old&#8221; webdesigner who still use table based layout will lesser, and maybe they gone by ten years later :))</p>
