		<description>well, everything goes faster right know. and &quot;old&quot; webdesigner that already comfortable with table layout design still use it and do not want to change their design with something new (and ofcourse better..) like CSS, even CSS have lot of benefit. but do not worry, by the time, &quot;old&quot; webdesigner who still use table based layout will lesser, and maybe they gone by ten years later :))</description>

		<description>By using CSS I can separate the elements that define how the page is styled from those that define the content. It is these standards that have enabled me to build my Web site using CSS for all the layout.</description>

		<description>I think that the majority of designers / developers would like to be taught correctly. Creating a site that is based upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3c-standards.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;W3C Standards&lt;/a&gt; using XHTML and CSS is the only way to go ahead.

Sadly as you have written there are lots of people out there that are still using tables, frames etc. to create said sites. These are the people that should take a long look at what they are doing and then go back to school and start learning the new way.

It is very hard to get people to re-think their methods as they have been creating sites for many years and they work. So why the change? An easy simplified answer is Accessibility, Usability and a general clean-up.</description>

The site looks *great*, but under the hood - bleeeeech!</description>

		<description>I would love to see educators, professors and the like drink the CSS Kool Aid. That is, those that haven&#039;t already, and I&#039;m glad to see more and more of them do so these days.

Google. Another vote for seeing Google stop being such a jerk and get their act together. They don&#039;t have to magically convert to valid markup and CSS or anything, but some basic semantics and the like would go a long way already.

The WAI. Yes, they know all about CSS and semantics and such already, but seriously, WCAG 2.0 is a horrid mess and it&#039;s counter-productive to the entire Web Standards movement.</description>
