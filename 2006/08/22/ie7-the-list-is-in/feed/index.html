		<description>Please look at http://www.afpncoh.org/2006npd/sponsors.htm. In IE6, there are cameras and links to jpg&#039;s and pdf&#039;s. There&#039;s even a &quot;Vew Ad&quot; with a link to a pdf. None of these show up when viewed in IE7. Ideas?</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been running IE7 RC1 along side Firefox, Opera and IE6 (no easy task getting both IE&#039;s to work alongside each other :/ )

I am still not impressed with IE7 and feel Microsoft have done too much work to make it &quot;vista&quot; compliant rather than web standards compliant.

Its okay trying to compete with Safari et-al but if your underlying core is still as flakey as its previous incarnations then your doomed.  I have found numerous problems with the way IE7 renders pages and elements. Sure its much more along the road in comparison to IE6 but when your someone who tries to follow the standards and expects at a very least, equal ability to Firefox.. well as you can imagine I am dissappointed but not surprised.

I&#039;ve heard rumor&#039;s Microsoft themselves are admitting that we won&#039;t get a completely compliant browser until IE8, probably by which point I will have given up on it all together which is a shame.

To really address the problems Microsoft needs to do a total rewrite of the browser as the truth is its still using a core that is out of date by a huge margin, much like their Operating System which needs a rethink and rewrite from the ground up.

Unfortunately due to the tie-in nature of MS and a reason why they will continue to trudge their crappy software on us means developers like us will have to put up with handicapping ourselves each time we develop a site as we have to take 10 steps back just to make sure IE is not falling over tring to display a simple element every other browser cans no issues with.

We live in hope :-)</description>

Example: see this 9 links:

CSS2 from IE7 is not finish, complete, to W3C specification.</description>

		<description>Still, it&#039;ll become the mac IE of the web - it&#039;s caught up, but it&#039;ll be years until they pass the features in firefox, opera, or safari. So now I can stress a little less that my builds won&#039;t break, but higher end features we have to wait... another 5 years? I see the reason for praise, but it feels like patting the slow kid on the back for doing such &#039;a nice job&#039; - we&#039;re comparing them to a scale all their own, not by the industry ambitious.</description>

		<description>@ChadL: Fortunately I&#039;ve had IE7 for a while (starting with beta 2 when the word was out that the rendering engine was final) and have bitten the bullet so to speak by going through all my sites, and those of my current and former clients, and have addressed all those IE7 issues that came up -- and there were a few. Fortunately now I can say bring it on; I&#039;m ready (and all my new stuff is tested on the beta 3 build as par for the course). It was a bit of a drag, and there were some issues, but they&#039;re all fixed. The biggest pain for me was addressing the &quot;whitespace bug&quot; on some of my nav lists, but was fixable by specifying a width; the easiest fix was the new &quot;hover bug&quot; on &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;/em&gt; style sheets by simply adding a:hover {} (with empty curly braces) to the CSS import statement.</description>

		<description>- Does the list mean IE7 will support attribute selectors? For example, one of the things I want to do is add a background image (PDF icon) each time the string &#039;.pdf&#039; is discovered in the href attribute.

- Does the &#039;background:fixed&#039; work mean that I can, for example, keep a menu bar at the top while the rest of the page scrolls, and the browsers that don&#039;t support it will scroll all (like they do now)?</description>

		<description>Yeah but those conditional comments look and feel so, well, dirty :) I try to avoid them as much as possible, but I guess this will be the easiest way to accomodate the visitors on IE7. Has anybody found any IE7 specific hacks?</description>

		<description>Exactly... 

Playing antagonist here; so many of us web developers have been eagerly awaiting IE7&#039;s arrival, and so many fail to see IE7 will only be available to a subset of those current IE6 users.

:(

Myself; I have been slowly weaning the sites I&#039;m working on over to using conditional comments rather than the traditional CSS filters.  I&#039;m anticipating IE7 to have it&#039;s own (new?) rendering issues so this - at least to me - seems like a safe approach to take.</description>
