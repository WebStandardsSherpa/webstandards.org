		<description>[...] You used &lt;embed&gt; to put the Flash on the page, right ?? Well, that won&#039;t work anymore, as you&#039;ve found out. You are going to have to use a different method of putting flash (or any other active content) into a web page. MS lost the EOLAS patent lawsuit, which is why people with PATCHED versions of IE and Windows have to click twice to see active content.

		<description>[...] The problem with the movie not playing right away is because of the &lt;embed&gt; tag and IE. MS lost the EOLAS lawsuit, so all active content is a problem if using &lt;embed&gt;. Use a different method: Valid Flash, video, and audio embed (object) markup - The Web Standards Project  I like the design, it&#039;s clean and the navigation is clear.  Under the hood.. Your pages have way too many errors, lacking DOCTYPES, and its a morass of nested tables... bleaahh. Too many inline styles, use your CSS file.  100MB of storage doesn&#039;t seem too fantastic when people can get 2 GIG from Gmail.   __________________ Web Mistress &amp; Web Standards Evangelist :) Tables Be Gone !!
