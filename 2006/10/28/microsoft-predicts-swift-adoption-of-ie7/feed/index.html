		<description>By the way, this is not an optional update, it&#039;s automatic, but, you can render all future auto updates to stop, even updates that will be helpful, what a deal!!!!!!</description>

		<description>I just recieved my update for IE7, what a surprise, if only I could read Chinese, yes, that&#039;s right, Chinese, and to add insult to injury, my outlook express was knocked out, my McAfee security was knocked out, but luckily for me my system restore took care of this nightmare, but sitting on my toolbar like a bug is the update shield, it will sit there forever as far as I&#039;m concerned, and all further updates perhaps will be blocked, thankfully.
If Microsoft wanted people to switch to Mac, they could not have done a better job!!!!!!!</description>

		<description>[...] An amusing tongue-in-cheek video by David Pogue covers the same ground in a more creative fashion. I have to say that I use Windows XP at work and I really don&#8217;t mind it that much. It does some things pretty well and I just recently began using my Dock like I use the Taskbar&#8230; it works for me. On the other hand, Explorer really bugs me and, if I were to advocate a boycott or some action to pressure Microsoft, it would be to advise everyone to use some other browser like Firefox or, for Mac users, Camino or Safari at home. At work, where they are forced to use Explorer, they can access their .asp stuff on the intranet, which usually looks pretty crappy anyways. But, on their own time they would be using a standards compliant browser to visit commercial and recreational sites on the web, sending the stats for competing, standards-friendly browsers off the charts. That should get their attention. [...]</description>

		<description>All IE-bashing aside, I think the distasteful part (for me) of the original post was the was MS says &quot;adoption will be swift&quot; as if market decisions will be at work. They&#039;ll &quot;force&quot; millions to download it vis automatic updates, whether they use it or not, and then trumpet those numbers relative to Firefox as &quot;proof&quot; that they are the choice of the people.

As for it being an &quot;optional&quot; download - social engineering will render that point moot. I almost dl&#039;ed it myself when I started accepting the automatic downloads without looking at the details.</description>

		<description>Peter and Matt, applause. We can&#039;t ignore Microsoft and hope it goes away, &#039;cos it ain&#039;t going anywhere, and we have to work with it. And some people seem to see their favourite operating systems like a favoured religion. Before long they&#039;ll be telling us we&#039;ll go to hell for using microsoft. Pah.</description>

		<description>MS have detailed info on the automatic update here: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/updatemanagement/windowsupdate/ie7announcement.mspx

As well as improvements to the rendering engine, the browser improves security for IE users, which I believe justifies it&#039;s categorisation as a high-priority update. Non-techie users wouldn&#039;t be aware that an update was available otherwise.

For Web developers it&#039;s great news since IE7 brings us closer to one set of standards without the constant cross-browser testing. For the interim, I expect it&#039;ll be a bit of a pain since IE7 RC sometimes needs entirely different layout hacks to IE6 and we&#039;ll have to support them both for a while.

I can&#039;t say I understand MS bashers, Mac snobs or Linux elitists. If you have a favourite piece of software, just use it, and stop wanting everyone else to feel like you too. I&#039;m old enough to make my own decisions.

For IE4/5/6, I think I&#039;ll eventually be doing what I do for NS4- users and serving them the content without a stylesheet. My clients can&#039;t usually afford to design for niche/proprietry systems but careful coding can ensure that the content is still usable.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m just so sick of all the old versions of IE that are still lurking around on the web. A lot of my customers are still using IE 5.01 and it&#039;s nearly impossible to keep up with problems.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t get the &quot;I h8 teh IE7, M$ is teh suxo&#124;2z&quot; routine.  IE7 is BETTER than IE6.

One blissful day in the future, IE6 will be relegated to obsoleteness with something like 0.5% market share, and I can stop hacking for it (and the 0.5% of people still using it can go hang).  I might still have some hacking to do for IE7, but a lot less than IE6.

The more &quot;cheating in the browser wars by pumping their browser into the OS through an automatic system update&quot; that microsoft does, the better, because every user who upgrades from IE6 to IE7 brings that previously mentioned joyous day of days just a teeny tiny bit closer.</description>

		<description>There&#039;s nothing wrong with wishful thinking, but we all know that IE &lt;em&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; going to just magically disappear. If Microsoft dropped IE altogether, we&#039;d still be stuck with IE 6 being the dominant browser for many years to come. Complaining that IE 7 is a much smaller step forward than the utopian ideal of &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt; switching to Firefox/Opera/Safari gets us nowhere.

And hey, if IE 7 somehow convinces even more people to switch, I&#039;m still happy.

Dave wrote: &quot;how long has html been depreciated for now?&quot;

Zero-point-zero milliseconds and not counting. Html 4.01 is still an official W3C recommendation. It&#039;s a common misconception that every new version of a W3C specification is intended to completely replace the old one.

Dave wrote: &quot;m$ gets bashed for a reason&quot;

They certainly are, for many good reasons. Are you implying that anyone here is blissfully unaware of those reasons?</description>
