			</div>

			<p>As part of his keynote at <a href="http://theajaxexperience.com/">The Ajax Experience</a> in Boston earlier this week, Chris Wilson, Lead Platform Architect for the IE team (and a WaSP Microsoft Task Force member), revealed that Internet Explorer 7 was downloaded about 3 million times within the first four days of its release. He also offered that, according to Microsoft&#8217;s own numbers, <q>90% of the Windows web share is running [Windows] XP</q>, which goes a long way toward relieving concerns that Microsoft&#8217;s plan to only offer <abbr title="Internet Explorer 7">IE7</abbr> to users of Windows XP and beyond will slow its adoption and never free us from the problematic world of <abbr title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> support:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.molly.com/2006/10/26/ie7-adoption-rate-faster-than-you-think/"><p>I think that you’ll actually see, and granted this is a little early since [it's] only been out for five days or something, &#8230; the curve on this [and it] will quickly be clear how soon we’ll get to ditch IE6 &#8230; I can’t really predict that, but I think you’ll find it’s going to be quicker than what most people expect today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris also mentioned that the adoption thus-far has come without Microsoft pushing the browser update via its Windows Update service and I don&#8217;t think anyone is ruling out the possibility that Microsoft may choose to go that route, eventually.</p>
<p>If Chris is right (and I hope he is), this is very good news for standards-based developers. While it is true that IE7 is far from perfect, it is a much needed step on the way to a world without CSS hacks and workarounds and one with more standardized DOM support. Having also had a few off-the-record conversations with folks from the IE team attending the event, I can honestly say I feel confident that we (the standards community) have Microsoft&#8217;s ear and that they are <em>very</em> interested in knowing what they can do to make our lives easier now and in what they are casually referring to as &#8220;IE.Next.&#8221;</p>

<p>The difference is that Firefox&#8217;s update will only work for active users of the browsatr. IE&#8217;s update will kick in for all relevant operating systems with Windows Update enabled.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;d be happy about IE7 adoption is it supported all of HTML4.  It still leaves out one of the elements: the Q element (aka the Q tag).  This is the most basic web standard, and MS doesn&#8217;t fully support it.</p>

<p>NO, it&#8217;s not.  You have to make the decision to download Firefox yourself first.  When version 2.0 came out I had to download it too.</p>
<p>Why would anyone (unless they didn&#8217;t understand web development standards) defend IE?</p>

												<p>Regardless of whether IE7 is good bad or indifferent, and ignoring Microsoft&#8217;s advantage v-a-v it&#8217;s dominant global position (both in terms of OSs and software) the release of IE7 is a welcome development. As for automatic updating, given that (publicly at least) MS beleive that IE7 offers users an enhanced browsing experience of course it is to be expected that it will be incuded in up dates.</p>
<p>From a web development perspective this release is interesting and (dare I say it) exciting.</p>

												<p>Compare 3 million IE7 downloads within 4 days to <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2006/10/firefox_2_milli.html" rel="nofollow">2 million Firefox 2 downloads in 24 hours</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to assume that most of the IE7 downloads were from developers, designers, journalists, and other browser manufacturers, not actual users. We&#8217;ll see the actual user numbers after IE7 is available as via Windows Update. (Keep in mind, it&#8217;s an optional update &#8212; Microsoft isn&#8217;t forcing users to upgrade.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those Firefox downloads are probably from users of all types &#8212; not just us Web folk. And since the download was actually available ahead of time (if you knew where to look on the FTP servers), many downloads took place before the release date &#8212; I wonder if those numbers were included?</p>
<p>Just some Saturday night musings&#8230; watching these download tallies is like waiting for Election Day results to come in!</p>

<p>(General rant (that&#8217;s been brewing for a long time) begins.)</p>
<p>I think this &#8220;bash-M$-no-matter-what-they-do-and-anyone-who-doesn&#8217;t-agree-with-everything-I-say-must-be-a-blindly-obedient-M$-slave-oh-and-by-the-way-did-I-mention-that-IE-sucks&#8221; routine is getting kinda old. As in &#8220;mouldy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <strong>huge and numerous flaws</strong> of IE have been detailed time and time again on this site. Even in this post, there&#8217;s the caveat: &#8220;While it is true that IE7 is far from perfect [...]&#8221;</p>
<p>But there are some people who <strong>can&#8217;t just be happy</strong> that the web might finally be able to progress a few small steps. After every post that even <em>mentions</em> IE 7, they pop in to &#8220;educate&#8221; us about the evils of M$ and the flaws of IE, as if we needed it.</p>
<p><strong>Attention, all M$-haters:</strong> We <strong>know</strong> how rotten M$ can be. And we <strong>know</strong> what a stinking pile of dung IE can be. And that&#8217;s <strong>exactly</strong> why we&#8217;re so happy about IE 7! If you can&#8217;t appreciate that, I say you&#8217;re just a bunch of posers.</p>
<p>(Rant over.)</p>

												<p>Thanks, Peter, you saved me the trouble of saying it :-)</p>
<p>I remember when work on IE7 was first announced, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/" rel="nofollow">IE Team blog</a> was full of comments by people saying &#8220;You have to push it out as an automatic update, otherwise it&#8217;ll be ages before we can stop supporting that crapheap IE6!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no doubt that these are the same people who are now crying &#8220;Foul!&#8221; when they get what they asked for.</p>
<p>The anti-MS ranting that has accompanied every step of the development of IE7 is an embarassment to the whole Web Standards community. It makes us look like a bunch of petulant, ill-informed brats who don&#8217;t know what we want except that we don&#8217;t want whatever we&#8217;re given.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to grow up and join the adult world, MS bashers. If you have a point to make then make it in a clear and well-reasoned manner (preferably without using dollar symbols in place of upper-case S). If you just want to bitch and whine, go to the playground and join the other adolescent malcontents. You won&#8217;t be missed.</p>

												<p>I think the ie7 release is good, i think ie7 breaking all those millions of sites is even better!! Hopefully, it will help a few million additional people realize that the biggest company in the history of the world can&#8217;t build nothing but crap *ss products, especially a browser that like another poster mentioned doesnt even meet html 4 standards yet and how long has html been depreciated for now? And those additional people will now go ahead and choose a good browser, i mean you can only be let down so many times before you change..</p>
<p>Someday we will be able to move the web forward, to bad it hinges on m$, hell we could be on web 4.0 by now if we werent sitting around waiting on the retarded kid (aka m$) to catch up all the time.</p>
<p>m$ gets bashed for a reason and being a web developer has really opened my eyes to what those reasons are&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>As developers we should be making a stink since its OUR job to make these sites viewable in which case m$ seems to do everything they can to make our lives miserable.</p>

												<p>The fact that 90% of Windows users has Windows XP doesn&#8217;t really help all that much, since Internet Explorer requires Service Pack 2. How many of those 90% has Service Pack 2 installed? My guess is less than 50%. Seeing that Internet Explorer 5.0 is still showing up on web statistic reports, considering the fact that it is soon 8 years old and that the upgrade restriction for earlier Windows versions was a lot more lenient than it is today (with WPGA etc), I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Internet Explorer 6.0 for at least 8 more years. Not at all.</p>

												<p>My significant other works for an insurance company, and the higher-ups have told everyone there to stick with IE6 because IE7 &#8220;breaks their intranet.&#8243; Using Firefox has never been allowed. I did not get too many details about what exactly breaks, but it seems that the warnings about companies keeping employees from upgrading are true in this case.</p>

												<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with wishful thinking, but we all know that IE <em>isn&#8217;t</em> going to just magically disappear. If Microsoft dropped IE altogether, we&#8217;d still be stuck with IE 6 being the dominant browser for many years to come. Complaining that IE 7 is a much smaller step forward than the utopian ideal of <strong>everyone</strong> switching to Firefox/Opera/Safari gets us nowhere.</p>
<p>And hey, if IE 7 somehow convinces even more people to switch, I&#8217;m still happy.</p>

<p>Zero-point-zero milliseconds and not counting. Html 4.01 is still an official W3C recommendation. It&#8217;s a common misconception that every new version of a W3C specification is intended to completely replace the old one.</p>

												<p>I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;I h8 teh IE7, M$ is teh suxo|2z&#8221; routine.  IE7 is BETTER than IE6.</p>
<p>One blissful day in the future, IE6 will be relegated to obsoleteness with something like 0.5% market share, and I can stop hacking for it (and the 0.5% of people still using it can go hang).  I might still have some hacking to do for IE7, but a lot less than IE6.</p>
<p>The more &#8220;cheating in the browser wars by pumping their browser into the OS through an automatic system update&#8221; that microsoft does, the better, because every user who upgrades from IE6 to IE7 brings that previously mentioned joyous day of days just a teeny tiny bit closer.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m just so sick of all the old versions of IE that are still lurking around on the web. A lot of my customers are still using IE 5.01 and it&#8217;s nearly impossible to keep up with problems.</p>

												<p>MS have detailed info on the automatic update here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/updatemanagement/windowsupdate/ie7announcement.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/updatemanagement/windowsupdate/ie7announcement.mspx</a></p>
<p>As well as improvements to the rendering engine, the browser improves security for IE users, which I believe justifies it&#8217;s categorisation as a high-priority update. Non-techie users wouldn&#8217;t be aware that an update was available otherwise.</p>
<p>For Web developers it&#8217;s great news since IE7 brings us closer to one set of standards without the constant cross-browser testing. For the interim, I expect it&#8217;ll be a bit of a pain since IE7 RC sometimes needs entirely different layout hacks to IE6 and we&#8217;ll have to support them both for a while.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I understand MS bashers, Mac snobs or Linux elitists. If you have a favourite piece of software, just use it, and stop wanting everyone else to feel like you too. I&#8217;m old enough to make my own decisions.</p>
<p>For IE4/5/6, I think I&#8217;ll eventually be doing what I do for NS4- users and serving them the content without a stylesheet. My clients can&#8217;t usually afford to design for niche/proprietry systems but careful coding can ensure that the content is still usable.</p>

												<p>All IE-bashing aside, I think the distasteful part (for me) of the original post was the was MS says &#8220;adoption will be swift&#8221; as if market decisions will be at work. They&#8217;ll &#8220;force&#8221; millions to download it vis automatic updates, whether they use it or not, and then trumpet those numbers relative to Firefox as &#8220;proof&#8221; that they are the choice of the people.</p>
<p>As for it being an &#8220;optional&#8221; download &#8211; social engineering will render that point moot. I almost dl&#8217;ed it myself when I started accepting the automatic downloads without looking at the details.</p>

												<p>[...] An amusing tongue-in-cheek video by David Pogue covers the same ground in a more creative fashion. I have to say that I use Windows XP at work and I really don&#8217;t mind it that much. It does some things pretty well and I just recently began using my Dock like I use the Taskbar&#8230; it works for me. On the other hand, Explorer really bugs me and, if I were to advocate a boycott or some action to pressure Microsoft, it would be to advise everyone to use some other browser like Firefox or, for Mac users, Camino or Safari at home. At work, where they are forced to use Explorer, they can access their .asp stuff on the intranet, which usually looks pretty crappy anyways. But, on their own time they would be using a standards compliant browser to visit commercial and recreational sites on the web, sending the stats for competing, standards-friendly browsers off the charts. That should get their attention. [...]</p>
