		<description>As Peter stated I&#039;ve discovered the same issue with Javascript array sizes. Code that has run fine pre IE7 now fails. I&#039;m curious if a solution is available. I&#039;m in agreement that with the advent and growth of AJAX and it&#039;s dynamic capabilities, imposing limits on Javascript within the browser is a step backwards.</description>

		<description>I have been looking at IE7 and in many ways it seems better, but I have a major problem with the way it is implementing JavaScript arrrays.

I have an old application that holds data in a large Javascript array.  This has always worked fine.

However, in IE7 it falls over.   It seems like it is just falling over when an array gets too big.

Has anyone else come across this problem or any related problem with IE7.

I have been hunting around and cannot find any reference to an upper limit to array sizes in JavaScript.</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;&#039;Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server-side scripting in every new design.&#039;&lt;/em&gt;

On the contary, javascript has had a fresh lease of life, enabling a whole range of web apps that owe there snappy performance  and rich featureset to ajax style scripting. 

After all lower server hits can only be a good thing, unless you&#039;re in the ad sales game!

Lets hope that IE7 js really does banish the sluggish performance and soul destroying memory leaks that developers have had to fight with IE6.</description>

		<description>javascript in IE7 RC1 still does not work well for me. Actualy, some javascript that can be executed with the IE7 beta 2 does not work in IE7 RC1.
One of my major problems with the IE&amp; is that I still cannot use properly an old MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0 since many links in it execute some javascript which can&#039;t be run with IE7.</description>

		<description>When reading some replies I am very doubtful if these are real improvements. See for example this reply:

		<description>While it is nice that IE 7 has performance and standards improvements in the JScript engine, it&#039;s catch-up arrival is late in the game. JScript (JavaScript) itself is still a client-side &quot;convenience&quot; script. Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server-side scripting in every new design. The future trend, mostly based on a culminating increase in data reliance and security, is to use none, or as little JavaScript as possible. If JavaScript is turned off, your web site and your forms better still work without it.</description>

		<description>Although we should all be happy because (a lot of us) are web designers and developers, maybe we shouldn&#039;t be happy because Microsoft is just putting bugs right that should have never existed in the first place!</description>

		<description>If you rate IE7 compared to Firefox / Opera, then yes it&#039;s nothing special.

If you rate IE7 compared to IE6 it&#039;s a huge leap forward.

Really happy with the improvements they&#039;ve made and hope there&#039;s more to come. Recently been designing a new CV site there&#039;s been very little in the way of specific IE7 fixes. Still have to have an additional css for IE6 and below, but at least that will eventually become a thing of the past.</description>

		<description>Ie7 is a huge improvement, I wonder though if it will actually make programmers work easyer in th NEAR future. Since they still will have maintain backwards compatibility.</description>
