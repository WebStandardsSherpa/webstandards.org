		<description>Hola a todos, we also use Drupal. Maybe we would try Plone too if I knew about it before (anyway, only if it is also in czech language..., I did not find it at Plone&#039;s website, ok).
I think that open source CMS will be preferred because for users - clients there is no different between &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; CMS. If you need some application to make it at your open source CMS, you can make it by yourself if you know how.
Maybe if some company making own CMS for sale would do some marketing and many people would know about their CMS, people would buy it, I think. But Im not sure if the investing the money would be returnable.</description>

		<description>We&#039;ve been using plone within our company to develop CMS for ourselves and clients for over a year now.

Of course we&#039;ve had some teething problems and as its open source you&#039;re continually waiting for updates and solutions from other users - but on the most part things move smoothly. As long as we develop the project properly I find the sites it produces very accessible compiling to w3c standards and it works very well with css which means we can always offer different and sometimes challenging designs without compromising on accessibility issues.

My clients are always happy with the end result and often surprised at how easy it is for them to use - especially when they have been used to using different types of CMS that are difficult to use for the masses.

Because its open source another big bonus (for us and the client) is the projects become much more cost effective with us only charging for the work we&#039;ve done rather then for a licence fee.</description>

		<description>At the moment I am using MODx to run my site, good its small at the mo but it will grow in time. The issues with accessibility and open source software is a problem that has been there for some considerable time.

With the system that I use I can to a point create a site that is fully accessible. The problem with open source software is that they are not bespoke. Changes are made on a rapid scale and trying to keep up isnt easy.

A site built using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3c-standards.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;w3c standards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/acronym&gt; is always on the correct path to succeed with accessibility issues.

The one major problem is where do you start and where do you stop. There are lots of arguments saying that a site cannot be accessible if it uses an extensive amount of JavaScript or Flash. Creating a site that is fully accessible can be very expensive, using some form of content management system can help, but no system is perfect and someone who has no knowledge of &lt;acronym title=&quot;Hypertext Markup Language&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/acronym&gt; or programming will have problems.</description>

		<description>Interesting article, also interesting by the lack of ATAG mention in the associated guide.  Not being a great fan of ATAG I&#039;m not suprised.

I&#039;m glad that the issue of accessible content management is being raised; there is some good work being done in both the open and closed source communities.  Should WASP look to set-up a task force in this area and requires any help please count me in :-)</description>
