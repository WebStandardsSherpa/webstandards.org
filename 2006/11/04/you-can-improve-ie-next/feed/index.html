		<description>Security and Support for css Standards is definately at the top of the list for example the select element in Internet Explorer 7 still does not support many css implementaions.  Also, we need to start thinking about the web more in terms of programming. The internet has been and is increasingly more so being used as an alternative solution for applications in intranets and in webpages on the internet. We need to add native elements to html such as datagrid combo boxes , tab structures, color pickers, date/time pickers, hierarchical tree structures and many other useful elements that will aid in the improvement and usability of the internet.</description>

		<description>What I&#039;d like to see is visually see a td with a colspan or rowspan attribute (kind of like how Firefox displays td tags with &quot;rowspans&quot; and &quot;colspans&quot;). Otherwise, a table might look ugly and seem like there was nothing filling its spot.</description>

		<description>1. Make it CSS 2.1 standards compliant. 
DON’T ADD ANYTHING until you fix all the broken and unfinished stuff FIRST. IE is a half-baked, defective product. It doesn’t need “new stuff”. It needs to work right first.</description>

		<description>It shouldn&#039;t be all that difficult to fix CSS measures, given that Firefox is open source and all the web standards are visible to everyone. Just copy and paste the rendering engine from Firefox into IE, and we&#039;re good. Heck, you do that with everything else (e.g. Word =&gt; WordPerfect, Excel =&gt; Lotus, Windows =&gt; Mac, Internet Explorer =&gt; Netscape Navigator, Zune =&gt; iPod, X-Box =&gt; Playstation).</description>

		<description>I would like to second Thomas Tallyce&#039;s comment (&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-10736&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#22&lt;/a&gt;) that says hasLayout needs to be refactored. A majority of Explorer&#039;s more persistent bugs and shortcomings are directly tied to this behavior.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve run into this CSS bug a number of times, unfortunately it was never fixed in IE7. A fix would be fantastic:

		<description>[...] You may recall that the DOM Scripting and Microsoft task forces, in collaboration with JS Ninjas, had been compiling a list of issues, needs, and wants for IE.next over the last few months (a list many of you contributed to as well, via your feedback). The list was to focus on what we wanted to see happen in terms of JavaScript support (as IE7 didn&#8217;t get much of an update in that area), but when it came down to it, there were other areas we really felt needed some love.
