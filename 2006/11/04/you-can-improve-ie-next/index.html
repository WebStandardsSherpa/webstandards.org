			<p>The Microsoft Task Force, DOM Scripting Task Force, and the JS Ninjas have been approached to help give the IE team some direction for improvements needed in IE.next, focusing mainly on JavaScript and the DOM. Together, we&#8217;ve begun assembling <a href="http://easy-designs.stikipad.com/ie-next-wishlist">a list of things we think need addressing</a> (bugs &#38; implementation issues, enhancements in language support, etc.). We&#8217;ve tried to keep it balanced, with some things for the seasoned JavaScript developer and some for the folks who are just starting out in the world of DOM Scripting, but we need your help to make sure we aren&#8217;t missing anything.</p>
<p>In the interest of time and keeping the process streamlined and organized, we&#8217;ve opted to make the wiki invitation-only, but we do need your input. Please have a look at what we&#8217;ve put together so far and leave your thoughts/ideas/recommendations in the comments below. We don&#8217;t know how soon we&#8217;ll need to get this list over to the IE team, so please don&#8217;t wait to long.</p>
<p>We will work to incorporate any relevant ideas into the final list, prioritize it, and pass it along to the IE team. Once the list is out the door, we will need to develop test cases for each item on it (some of which we&#8217;ve already begun), so if you are interested, please let us know that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We&#8217;re not guaranteed to get everything we ask for, but they <em>are</em> listening.</p>

												<p>A few things that seem to be missing from the list:</p>
<p>1) Implement DOM 2 Events (event bubbling and capturing, not just bubbling).<br />
2) Implement E4X. It&#8217;s a great little ECMAScript extension that is so much easier to use than the XML DOM. I&#8217;d almost prefer this over the JS 1.7 stuff.<br />
3) Better custom exception support. If I create my own type of Error object that has a message property, that property should be displayed when an error is thrown (now it just gives a generic message, only using an Error object shows the actual error message in IE).</p>
<p>A couple things I disagree with:<br />
1) I don&#8217;t think IE should recognize white space in between DOM elements as text nodes. White space has no relevance between DOM elements (I&#8217;d also like Firefox to get rid of this too).<br />
2) I don&#8217;t think arguments should inherit from Array. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to want to change the order of arguments that were passed in or to change their contents. I&#8217;d be more in favor of a base Collection type from which Array and arguments could inherit useful methods, but Array should be read-write and arguments should be read-only. NodeList doesn&#8217;t inherit from Array, I don&#8217;t see why arguments should. That being said, perhaps access to Arguments.prototype would solve everyone&#8217;s issues.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t need a list of everything that&#8217;s broken/missing, they need to know what the important ones are. It&#8217;s the prioritisation that&#8217;s required.</p>

												<p>As <a href="#comment-10447" rel="nofollow">Paul said</a>, it is the prioritization that matters as well as seperating the wheat from the chaff. I can only imagine how daunting it must be to look at the huge lists of change requests out there and not know where to begin. Part of our task is to figure out which bits are really key.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#comment-10444" rel="nofollow">@Nicholas:</a></strong> Those are some great suggestions. And as for your disagreements with things on the list currently, these are the same discussions we are currently having. We&#8217;ll see what happens to these over the next week or two and how the votes go once we begin the prioritization process.</p>

												<p>1. Make sure the DOM is actually properly structured tree, even when the markup has badly nested elements.  See this <a href="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C%21DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cb%3E%3Ci%3Etest%3C/b%3E%3C/i%3E" rel="nofollow">test case</a>.</p>

<p>3. Support for the DOM interfaces Element, Node, etc. so we can use things Node.prototype to extend them and access constants like Node.ELEMENT_NODE.</p>

												<p>Ok. Here&#8217;s my priority list.</p>
<p>#1 Fix what&#8217;s broken before adding anything new. <strong>Fix CSS bugs: known, reproducible bugs, testcased bugs reported bugs by web designers</strong>.</p>
<p>#2 Fix bugs that creates important problems like crash and cpu maxed due to infinite loop: those are serious bugs which should be addressed first. Yes, there are bugs like that! The MADD (Magical Act of Disapearing Divs) bug reported by<br />
John A. Bilicki III (<a href="http://www.jabcreations.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jabcreations.com/</a>) on September 2nd 2006 at IE Blog does that in IE7 final!</p>
<p>#3 Fix the many <strong>collapsing adjoining margins</strong> (see section 8.3.1 of CSS 2.1): it&#8217;s now crystal clear that this stops several columnar layout from working as expected and those bugs are major headaches for web developers because other excellent-compliant browsers don&#8217;t behave like IE7.</p>
<p>#4 Fix float implementation: float bugs are numerous, well reported and well documented by a lot of people now. Many people use or rely on float to create columnar layouts.</p>
<p>#5 Fix the CSS 1 tests that IE7 fails. That&#8217;s right: CSS 1 tests.</p>
<p>#6 Fix z-index: visit <a href="http://www.aplus.co.yu/css/z-pos/index2.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aplus.co.yu/css/z-pos/index2.php</a><br />
Wrong z-index implementation bugs by Aleksandar Vaci&#263;</p>
<p>#7 Fix CSS position-related bugs: there are still bugs related to position in IE7.</p>
<p>#8 Fix CSS inline box model bugs: e.g. a parent inline element should not grow, should not stretch because of its inline nested child.</p>
<p>#9 Fix all of the background (background-image, background-color) related bugs</p>
<p>#10 Fix the inherit and inheritance related bugs</p>
<p>Fix known, reproducible, already documented bugs. And don&#8217;t implement something new before fixing known, reproducible and already documented bugs.</p>

												<p>Full CSS2.1 (includes CSS1) compliance. When that&#8217;s set, full DOM2 (includes DOM1) compliance would be nice. That should take care of all CSS and scripting related bugs too, hopefully. Full PNG compliance is also needed. When that&#8217;s set, start implementing new stuff like SVG, CSS3, DOM3, etc. It&#8217;s still much too early for IE to implement any new features.

												<p>My number one request would be that the IE team spend the time required to refactor out hasLayout.</p>
<p>While the IE7 engine seems to have got rid of a lot of problems, it&#8217;s clear that engine still contains a log of float bugs etc. From all I&#8217;ve read, until hasLayout is refactored out, these bugs are going to continue to surface. This situation likely to get increasingly problematic as more complex layouts, as well as increasingly demanding specs from the W3C and others, come forward. Piling hack after hack onto a 5-year old engine simply will cease to work.</p>

												<p>What I would like to see fixed, are all the bugs I already reported (with testcases) using the <a HREF="https://connect.microsoft.com/feedback/default.aspx?SiteID=136" rel="nofollow">IE7 feedback</a> mechanism.  I would love to re-state that list of bugs, but since the feedback site is &#8220;temporarily&#8221; closed, I can&#8217;t.  Here are the ones I remember off the top of my head:</p>
<p>* input and textarea fields using a style of width:100% become too large when they have a large value for the value attribute.<br />
* the select object&#8217;s add() method takes a <a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/methods/add.asp" rel="nofollow">number (index) for the second parameter</a>, while the DOM states this should be an <a HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/html.html#ID-14493106" rel="nofollow">object (&#8220;before&#8221;)</a>.<br />
* querying the value of the offsetWidth attribute can change the display/layout of items on the page (new in IE7)</p>

												<p>All my improvements are in CSS :<br />
1. display: table/table-row/table-cell/inline-block (all the other designers I talk to rave about the table box model, we love it!),<br />
2. if possible, implement the &#8220;flexible&#8221; box model of XUL too (Gecko + WebKit have it), very useful to vertically center boxes, an ongoing pain in CSS 2.1,<br />
3. A selection of CSS 3 stuff (no need to implement it all guys!):<br />
      &#8211; multiple backgrounds,<br />
      &#8211; multi-columns (god, I&#8217;ve been waiting for this since the last century),<br />
      &#8211; opacity (browser sniffing and applying &#8220;filters&#8221; doesn&#8217;t cut it),<br />
      &#8211; downloadable typography: if all the other players haven&#8217;t implemented your model, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s encumbered by patents. Please do something to unfreeze the situation, we are all *dying* for downloadable fonts! If I have to write &#8220;text-indent: -9999px&#8221; once again my brain will explode!<br />
4. We all love the WHATWG stuff: yay for datagrids! yay for canvas! and storage, and menus, etc etc. </p>

												<p>(I already posted this on quirksmode.org but obviously it didn&#8217;t pass the scrutiny/censorship of PPK)</p>
<p>I have very mixed feelings about this, it looks to me as if MS is *again* asking the webcommunity to do their groundwork for them, and with what guarantee that they will actually listen this time?</p>
<p>The mere fact that &#8216;prioritizing&#8217; is mentioned implies that IE.next is also not expected to be on the same technological level as other browsers which is a bad position to start with. Basically imo it is crucial that IE.next should (roughly) support what other browsers already support now in various areas including a.o. CSS, (X)HTML, DOM and Javascript. The last thing we need is yet another version of IE that is still the least dominor but has different behavior and different bugs from the previous version, we already got that with IE7. It is simply too late to improve IE gradually, we want what we have in other browsers and we want it yesterday and not smeared out over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>I dug up a small list of JS-related bugs that I kept around somewhere just to be helpfull but I have no intention of writing actual testpages for them; MS should be capable of doing that themselves:</p>
<p>String.substr(-1)<br />
Object.toSource()<br />
Element.style.fontSize = &#8216;inherit&#8217;<br />
&#8216;string&#8217;[1]<br />
dont reset lastIndex on RegExp literal outside scope<br />
performance array-methods<br />
performance string-concattenation<br />
XmlHTTPRequest prototyping<br />
ActiveX object instance expandos<br />
set innerHTML on fi TABLE/TBODY/SELECT</p>

												<p>Well, it seems that all of this has totally left the in-expert in the lurch.  I utilize E-Mail and Instant Messenger for a variety of reasons.  </p>
<p>It is not my intent to become a computer expert.  Frankly I have no idea what most of what has been posted here means, nor do I want to know.</p>
<p>What I want is, to be able to interact with E-Sites on The Net, without hassels.  That is becoming more and more difficult.  Although my computer is older and is programmed with Windows 98-II, I am finding that this stuff is too complex for my poor old &#8216;Puter to understand and then translate it for my edification.</p>
<p>Why should I have to discard a perfectly good Computer and it&#8217;s programming, with the incredible difficulties of trying to keep my already installed programs and files and folders, because someone thinks they have a better way?  If all of this Fol-dee-rol IS necessary then it must be made available, FOR FREE, with SIMPLE availability to all of us who are barely computer literate.  My illiteracy is not hurting anyone else.  So let me be illiterate.  Just supply the necessary upgrades in a simplistic manner and for free.  I only want them if they are necessary for my accessing sites on the Net. Apparently they are, or I wouldn&#8217;t be here in the first place.</p>

												<p>When styling a select element in a form, if width is applied, the options are cut off if the text string in an option is longer than the select box is wide. For example, if I say:</p>

												<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that the accept attribute on the input element isn&#8217;t supported yet (not just in IE), but it&#8217;s part of the W3C specification. Here&#8217;s a quick example of it&#8217;s usage:</p>
<p>As I understand it, the intended functionality is that the file dialog which appears when you click the Browse button is supposed to filter on the mime type so that files with other mime types are not shown.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s not on the list yet, I figured I should speak up. I also sent an e-mail to the IE team, but if the keepers of the wishlist think it&#8217;s worthy there&#8217;s a better chance it will get implemented sooner than later.</p>

												<p>I don&#8217;t think MS is capable of fixing their rendering engine. They are on version 7 of their product and it is still horribly broken. It&#8217;s time for them to admit defeat and ditch the core rendering engine and replace it either with WebKit, Gecko, or buy/license Operas. Any move that doesn&#8217;t either completely fix the outstanding rendering bugs or replaces their engine entirely proves to me that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t really give a crap about standards, and is just paying lip service everytime that ask for feedback.</p>

												<p>@ Charles S. Cavanaugh (Comment #40)</p>
<p>In regards to your comment about why all the things in this comment thread don&#8217;t apply to you the non-computer savvy individual; the fact is that all of these comments effect you.  No, you may not care about CSS Standards compliance, or JavaScript bugs in IE, but it still effects you.  You say all you want is for the websites you visit to better serve you, but in order to do that they need these technologies in place and working seamlessly.  Personally, I&#8217;d rather spend my time making the end user happy by adding functionality than worrying about making sure something works at all or looks good in Internet Explorer.  So much time is wasted when you have to hack things together to make it work in IE.</p>
<p>Alright, now to get back on topic.  As it has been said a million times before, CSS compliance would be my biggest complaint.  Maybe add the ability to use min/max width?</p>

												<p>Tooltips. So we all know that tooltips are supposed to be what is in the title on the link right? And we all know that IE shows the alt tag as the tooltip. While I don&#8217;t have a problem that IE shows the alt, I do have a problem that it is inconsistent with other browsers in that it gives the alt as a tooltip precedence over the title (the link destination) as a tooltip, i.e. if you have both the alt is show and the title isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Is there an argument not to change this to be consistent from Microsoft? I&#8217;m not saying dont show an alt tooltip, only that if there is a title attribute on the link that this takes precedence.</p>

												<p>One more thing that I wanted to mention:<br />
The IE developers stated some time ago that implementing standards is difficult because CSS and HTML got some parts that define certain things differently.</p>
<p>Thats actually the reason why display: table-*; <em>can&#8217;t</em> be implemented, or so they say.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is far more important to make todays browsers CSS-browsers (with knowledge of HTML), because CSS is used for XML as well (which can also use display: table-*;).<br />
So in my opinion when HTML and CSS are contrary, implementing it the CSS way is the right way. This should be the ultimate goal of IE.Next.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could make sense to implement the CSS-Tables into standard-compilant Mode (as this is definitely the Mode good desingers are using) and keep the HTML-Tables for QuirksMode (which is actually the way IE developers did it in the IE6-&gt;IE7 jump).</p>
<p>And again: the CSS1 inherit keyword is very important. It&#8217;d make my life way easier even if they just implemented it for color and background-color.</p>

												<p>Security and Support for css Standards is definately at the top of the list for example the select element in Internet Explorer 7 still does not support many css implementaions.
