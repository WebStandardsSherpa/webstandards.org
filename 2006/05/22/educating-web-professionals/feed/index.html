		<description>&quot;At the same time, formal training programs began to appear. Unfortunately, many of these programs began to teach the same bad practices.&quot;

that´s always the same. the first professionals start teaching some stuff and earn good money with it. then there are some other who don´t act like real professionals but they call themself professional also also earn good money too at startup until the people realize that there are some real good teachers and some bad ones.

another problem now is that we have got a great diversity of different browsers and OS and so it´s getting harder for starters to design a page which is compatible to all browsers.

Some more infos about the Education Task Force would be really interesting</description>

		<description>After reading your post I realised that this problem still goes on. I spent 3 years in Germany carrying out a Web Development Diploma and our professors were teaching the old boy stuff. I was a master with frames and tables. I woke up half way through my course and started teaching myself standards using XHTML and CSS. Sadly there arent enough people out there that can actually teach everything that is required to be a good developer / programmer.
The majority of programmers out there are still using bad habits and creating sites that cant be used throughout the web.
Im not perfect but I think im on the right lines.
Please keep up the good work. Maybe you will visit my site sometime when its finished, then you can see my little bit to keeping the web clean.</description>

		<description>People who are teaching and managing to keep on top of the changes in the Web world are few and far between. How does one find out more about the Education Task Force (Sorry if this is a stupid question). If anyone could email me info that would be great ( lloydjohnson@gmail.com ).

		<description>After reading the interview transcript I find it good to know that educational figures take such a personal interest in their work and the knowledge they pass on to others. Teachers such as José will no doubt be largely responsible for the shift towards web standards by the developers of tomorrow.</description>
