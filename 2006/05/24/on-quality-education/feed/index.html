		<description>I so far haven&#039;t found a college or university that provides quality program for Web Development or Graphic Design. Or at least one that will make you a professional. 
This is bad but it is true. My personal experience shows me that self education in this field is much better that spending years in a college that will show you only the basis. Moreover, nowadays you can find so many professional and most importantly up-to-date courses and tutorials online, some of which are worth even more than a university degree.
Sadly, usually paper books are being published with a bit of delay and it turns out that the web is the right solution if you want to be up-to-date with the current trends and standards.
My advice to those who really want to become professional web designers and developers is to bet on self-improving and constantly search the web for new articles/books/tutorials/useful forums. It is far better than take a university degree and stop your education there.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m happy to say that we teach XHTML in my beginning web class, and standards will be included more and more as I continue to gain expertise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Does this mean we&#039;re going to have even more web coders filling the web with XHTML served as tag-soup HTML?</description>

		<description>I&#039;m a web design teacher (and do-er as well, thank you) at the Memphis College of Art and have found since I started teaching that most beginning web design books, even recent ones, sadly still have large sections that discuss table-based layout, frames, even deprecated tags (like ). Suggestion to writers: avoid even mentioning deprecated tags because they&#039;re, well, deprecated, and you&#039;re book will be outdated as soon as they glue the cover on it.

I have looked at the table of contents in Ian Lloyd&#039;s book. It looks good and I&#039;ll probably be switching to it, but I only wish it focussed more on design (XHTML and CSS) and less maybe on adding a blog or getting your site on-line. In that regard it&#039;s more of a how-to than a text book, if that makes sense. It makes me have to also use something like Stylin&#039; With CSS to supplement it, thus requiring my students to spend more money.

I still haven&#039;t found that one killer book, maybe the EduTF&#039;s work will encourage someone to put one together.</description>
