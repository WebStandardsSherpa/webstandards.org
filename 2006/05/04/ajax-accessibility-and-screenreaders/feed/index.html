		<description>I would thought a reseach is aimed to improve things. Ajax is bringing web experience to new level, while screen readers (or shall I say html readers) remain in their &quot;stone age&quot; and have no intention to self reform over the past decade.</description>

		<description>[...] Well, obviously, more user testing is always called for. What I&#8217;d love to see, although I&#8217;m not capable of putting it together myself, would be a full scale accessibility study of Flash and AJAX websites which have been specifically designed with accessibility in mind. User testing, limitations, the whole banana. Accessibility needs better awareness of using Flash. AJAX has received a fair amount of attention: articles from Standards-Schmandards, WebAIM, WebStandards.org, and many others have given developers a fair shot at addressing the limitations and possibilities in AJAX accessibility. Flash has been almost entirely disregarded by the web standards and accessibility community. I&#8217;d like to see it given an equal chance. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Just a &#8216;micro-posting&#8217; from me on the topic of Ajax and Accessibility. With the recent research presented by fully-sighted gurus James Edwards and Joe Clark, many of us have been enlightened once more to the need for creating accessible web applications in the face of new techniques that update page content without a page refresh. This quote, from an article in Computerworld, really brought home the impact of not paying heed to to this and just how confusing some of the new web applications can be for blind users. Note that the person quoted is blind and emphasis added is mine: [...]</description>

		<description>It seems odd to me that someone who says they know nothing about it would be giving a speech about it Joe Clark. Even still i would have loved to have been in attendance at the Iceland confrence i know I will make next years.

Thanks for the tip Ian to absorb i was just flying thru it. In my opinon why waste the time trying when there are so many other viable web standards options out there.</description>

		<description>Oh, James, you scooper, you. I am still proofing the speaking notes and original test results from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeclark.org/ice/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Iceland presentation&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. Should be up today. Hint: All Jaws and VoiceOver users tested could use Basecamp, to my surprise. It was not, however, very convenient in most cases.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve suspected the results of this research for a while and have been avoiding using AJAX because of it. Now I know I made the right decision for a couple of applications I&#039;m developing - I would be using AJAX merely for the sake of using it and it would be shutting out potential users.</description>
