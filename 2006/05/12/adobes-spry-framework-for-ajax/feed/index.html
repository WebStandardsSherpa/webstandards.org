		<description>I noticed a comment on a JSON list that there is no standard for an ajax dataset.

Isnt Spry a chance to propose one?</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve been looking at prerelease 1.4 and it looks very good. I will probably wait for the final release to try anything serious though.</description>

		<description>Anyone notice Adobe&#039;s acquisition of Interakt? Maybe they gave up trying to do AJAX themselves so they bought it! I would put forward that if you want to experience the power of Ajax in a nice to use IDE the have a look at ATLAS…VS2005 is nice a nd strict on implementing standard code, just try and type that attribute in uppercase!</description>

		<description>I agree with Andreas. I&#039;ve only had a quick fiddle with Spry, but it is supremely easy to work with - it only took a few minutes to knock up a working accordian control. Generally speaking there are - as mentioned - a few custom attributes which break validity, and a few  tags littering the mark-up, but it&#039;s a beta, it could be fixed, I&#039;m sure.

On the Flex/Ajax issue, I don&#039;t feel that there is a conflict. Adobe has lanched the FLEX/Ajax bridge allowing Ajax controls access to FLEX functionality - it allows you to take a mix-and match approach to interface richness. FLEX is a far richer and more responsive platform than Ajax, but sometimes you might want the best of both worlds...</description>

		<description>I tried the prerelease 1.3 and it`s really quit easy to work with this framework. There are a view things that do not validate but maybe the final release will solve these problems.</description>
