		<description>First, to Adam Messinger, Expression isn&#039;t completely compatible with the DWT templates in Dreamweaver. Although the templates in Expression use the same file extension, the editable regions start with BeginEditable rather than TemplateBeginEditable and SessionBeginEditable as in Dreamweaver. Of course, a simple Find/Replace will fix this in all of your template files. Then you have to go through all of your pages and re-attach the templates. It&#039;s a real pain for a website with hundreds of pages... trust me.

Two other problems I&#039;ve found with Expression that didn&#039;t give me trouble in Dreamweaver are root-relative links in local files and lack of non-ASP server technologies (as pointed out by Adam).

The relative links issue doesn&#039;t effect the pages once they&#039;re published, but if you use links in your pages relative to the root of the site, rather than the current page, they won&#039;t preview properly. Not that it&#039;s a huge deal, since I do almost all of my work in code view, but it would be nice to have my images appear in design view. And if your site has multiple folders, links relative to the root are much easier to manage.</description>

		<description>Mac users who&#039;d like the low-down on Expression Web Designer might be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalmediadesigner.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=43025&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft&#039;s Expression Web Designer vs. Adobe&#039;s Dreamweaver&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this Expression vs. Dreamweaver comparison&lt;/a&gt; from Digital Media Designer. I&#039;m disappointed (though not at all surprised) to read that ASP.NET 2.0 is the only supported server-side language. My first bit of feedback for Microsoft will be a request for some kind of plugin system for additional user-contributed language support. PHP and JSP are a must, and support for Ruby (on Rails) and Python (Django) would be nice to see.

On the positive side, the DMD article has this to say about standards support:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

You will find that, as you begin your page layout, Microsoft gently nudges you into using standards. Unless you get in and code by hand, Web Designer does not allow you design a page that is not CSS- or accessibility-compliant. This is no small achievement. Dreamweaver has been wrestling for years on how to add easy support for CSS and accessibility, without you having to take a night course in the two technologies.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good news, as is the compatibility with Dreamweaver&#039;s DWT template files.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, as with many current Microsloth software releases, Expression does not run on the Windows OS. It runs on Windows XP only. This means anyone with older hardware and sofware can’t use it at all.

It seems to me this is part of continuing Microsloth ploy to sell more OS software.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I understand the frustration that users of older computers must feel, but it&#039;s important to note that Windows XP &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the Windows OS for all practical intents and purposes. It would be nearly impossible for MS to continue offering support and compatibility for the Windows 9x generation of hardware and software --- the expense and logistics would be a nightmare.

Apple doesn&#039;t make Keynote compatible with Mac OS 9, nor does it offer tech support for that antiquated platform. Why do people expect any different from Microsoft? While it has its problems, Windows XP (especially with the recent service pack 2) solved most of the stability and security headaches of previous Windows releases. Any computer user would be doing themselves a favor to upgrade, especially power users and web professionals. A computer that runs XP very well can be had today for no more than a few hundred dollars, and it&#039;s a worthwhile investment.

A professional requires professional tools, reliability, and security. Microsoft needs to be able to turn away from the past at some point if it&#039;s expected to continue making progress away from its history of buggy, insecure software that focuses on MS lock-in instead of solving users&#039; problems. These are the facts of life for people who work with digital media professionally. Once accepted, it&#039;s clear that these principles pave the way for Microsoft to make the progress it sorely needs, not just toward better support of Web standards but also toward a more responsible and sustainable corporate ethic.</description>

		<description>I just spent the morning using Expression Web Designer and have to say that I am very impressed with this software package.  It&#039;s roots may lie in FrontPage, but all of the messy code FP generated appears to have been replaced with standards compliant output.  Of course, bugs still exist and the help file is a real mess, but that is why Microsoft have released this as a CTP.  I would strongly encourage WASP readers to try out this revamped web design tool and submit as much feedback to Microsoft as possible.</description>
