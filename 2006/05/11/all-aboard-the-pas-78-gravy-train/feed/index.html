		<description>Agreed. I&#039;m still interested in what penetration the PAS 78 doc is achieving? Anyone who how many they have got out there, ideally not including all of us buying a copy :-)</description>

		<description>To echo the other comments, great write-up, Patrick. It&#039;s quite depressing that this kind of thing is happening again, this time with PAS 78, but I guess it was to be expected to some extent.

Such misrepresentation &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be down to misunderstanding the document - but as you point out, Pat, where is this specific recommendation of their products? It&#039;s one thing to claim compliancy with something that isn&#039;t a standard, but to falsely claim a recommendation, as appears to be the case here, is blatant, dodgy marketing. Alas, perhaps not blatant to the general public.

In my mind, though, such misrepresentation serves to oust companies of questionable practice/intent from the industry by its peers. The question is whether that is more damaging to such companies than the benefit of questionable practices.</description>

		<description>&quot;I do find myself wondering what the response from BSI or the DRC might be if they became aware of PAS 78 being used in this manner.&quot;

I actually copied in the DRC&#039;s press contact on my first email to BrowseAloud on this, but got zero response from them as well...</description>

		<description>I do find myself wondering what the response from BSI or the DRC might be if they became aware of &lt;abbr title=&quot;Publically Available Specification&quot;&gt;PAS&lt;/abbr&gt; 78 being used in this manner. The document was certainly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; meant to be used as a list of recommended suppliers, or solutions, and, as I understand it, great pains were taken to try and avoid references that might imply an endorsement. 

However, there will always be those who may try to misrepresent even the most neutral of documents for their own promotional ends in the hopes of impressing Joe Public who, although he may have heard of &lt;abbr&gt;PAS&lt;/abbr&gt; 78, almost certainly won&#039;t have actually read it. The end result could be described as the  &quot;Chinese Whispers&quot; marketing approach. If direct pressure doesn&#039;t have any effect, the only other response may be to reiterate what &lt;abbr&gt;PAS&lt;/abbr&gt; 78 is and what it isn&#039;t and draw attention to specific possible misrespresentations - accidental or otherwise.

Which, of course, is exactly what this article does. Nice one!</description>
