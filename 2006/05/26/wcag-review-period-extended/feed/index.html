		<description>[...] There&#8217;s been some excellent discussion about the last call for comments on WCAG 2.0, both on the Web (see Joe Clark&#8217;s &#8220;To Hell with WCAG 2&#8221; and on w3c lists), and also in the hollowed-out volcano where the WaSP Accessibility Task Force meet. The fact that the w3c have extended the review period shows that they&#8217;re listening to legitimate criticism. [...]</description>

		<description>Tanny,

That&#039;s an interesting comment: &quot;When writing specifications I believe that it is a good idea to create examples so that you can see if it works in the “real” world.&quot;

There are many ways to develop a technical specification. Keep in mind that WCAG 2.0 is a Last Call Working Draft. The next step is usually &quot;Candidate Recommendation&quot; (CR). During the CR phase, most of the time, W3C WGs produce a test suite for the technology. It means a series of test cases (what you label examples) which shows if the techniques/features are implementable. When these test cases have been produced, we can check if the techniques/features are implementable and produce an implementation report. 

It is also a very good way to review a specification. When one&#039;s doesn&#039;t agree with a feature in a specification, the best way to demonstrate that it has flaws or that it is underspecified, is to create a test case. Then it&#039;s easier to articulate the discussion on a concrete example.

I encourage any person commenting to create concrete test cases when sending a comment, it helps a lot to move forward the discussion.  A specification is a difficult and long process, it is even more difficult when the topic is popular (CSS/HTML/Accessibility).</description>

		<description>When writing specifications I believe that it is a good idea to create examples so that you can see if it works in the &quot;real&quot; world. To be widely accepted the text should be clear and to the point. I believe that WCAG 2 is a failure in that it is unclear and not to the point.</description>

		<description>Which is actually the case: WCAG 2 has general usability faults that cause it to be unapproachable or it is naturally long, dense, and no fun to read because specifications *specify*?</description>
