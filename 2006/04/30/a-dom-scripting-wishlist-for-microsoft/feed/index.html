		<description>&quot;Internet Explorer’s JavaScript and DOM support is pretty darn good and IE7 introduces a few updates&quot;

Sorry, but I have to disagree. IE supports one feature from DOM 1, fragments from a few others in DOM 1 and 2, and incompatible versions of others (such as its own version of DOM 2 stylesheets and DOM 2 events). It still has several problems even with the parts that it does support.
http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/jsexamples/hasFeature.html

That is certainly not &quot;pretty darn good&quot;. It&#039;s an embarassment. Its level of DOM support is absolutely pitiful compared with other browsers. Opera, Gecko, KHTML leave it to eat their dust. iCab, the little browser written by just two developers (one for the JS engine, and one for everything else), supports far far more. Even ICE supports more. The one or two updates in IE 7 are all-but nonexistent, barely worthy of mention.

That&#039;s why PPK&#039;s article is needed. Not because IE&#039;s DOM support is pretty good, but because for such a widely used browser, it is pathetic, and in desperate need of an update. The hope is that MS will live up to their promise, and deliver something better for IE 8.</description>

		<description>PPK&#039;s site seems to be down. A look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28DOM%29 might give some useful ideas. personally I find the faulty behaviour with getAttribute() and setAttribute() to be very annoying. Adding support for getComputedStyle() would also come high on my wish-list.</description>
