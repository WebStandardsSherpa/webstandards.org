		<description>This won&#039;t work too well for sites with a complete seperation of content and structure (IE all div layouts like my site).

Good idea in general, tricky execution.</description>

		<description>I would just like to say that I really loved the idea when I read about it. My site started as a school club for our college group of friends and has moved into a community. We all graduated with a major in web design and still trying to decide what to do with our site at the moment, but I took off the css for April 5th! Not all of my vistors and members understood, but it got noticed. Thx for the idea to try to push web standards!</description>

		<description>[...] Surely you&#8217;ve got to know at least one of those. It was even digg&#8217;d to the hompage (nevermind the fact that the comments are generally useless over there). More importantly, it had the support from WebStandards.org which ultimately is what it&#8217;s all about. [...]</description>

		<description>Create a site with old fashion code (i.e. table layout, inline style). Remove the CSS. Oh there was already none. Oh okay, one to change the font, just to say there&#039;s one. Here, now look my site on the CSS Naked day. It looks like... the original one with a different font.

Take a semantically designed html with a fine tuned css design. Look at the site on the CSS Nake day. It looks like... plain text with some titles bigger than the rest.

I don&#039;t really see the point of the CSS Naked day except for adding one more argument for those who don&#039;t support CSS. You won&#039;t make the point for the others, since they are already convinced.</description>

As a result it seems like more of an exercise in reinforcing the need for visual design rather then reinforcing the need for a strong foundation behind that design.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yup. Visual design is useful and valuable.</description>

		<description>[...] I&#8217;ve stripped off all my CSS for the day (and maybe a few more days). Why? It&#8217;s the first annual CSS Naked Day. Several of my favorite blogs have gone naked as well, including Adactio and Clagnut. There&#8217;s also a mention on The Web Standards Project. [...]</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t think that the idea is a bad one. Or at least it wouldn&#039;t be if the default browser style sheets didn&#039;t stink so much.

More then anything what was lost when I&#039;ve hit 3 or 4 &quot;naked&quot; sites today among my course of browsing was context and other visual clues and I just find I&#039;m spending too much looking for what I want on a page / where I want to start reading rather then doing what I came to do then leaving. As a result it seems like more of an exercise in reinforcing the need for visual design rather then reinforcing the need for a strong foundation behind that design.</description>

		<description>Hmm, shame I just found this now, or I&#039;d have actually done it. I think I&#039;d have needed a bit more lead time.

That said, erm, how come The Web Standards Project dot org hasn&#039;t done it?</description>

		<description>I think this is a foolish, designer-centric idea that will only hurt usability and accessibility for end users for 24 to 48 hours, while producing minimal benefits (beyond mutual back-patting) for the developers.

It sends the signal that website design and functionality exists only for the benefit of the designers and not the end users; end user functionality IS affected by style sheets, and this statement says that users don&#039;t matter as long as developers &quot;learn&quot; that CSS is...something.

Count me in the naysayers.
