		<description>[...] Hopefully you&#8217;re all familiar with the phrase in the heading and it&#8217;s not some strange quirky British turn of phrase that&#8217;s got many of you scratching your heads. It is, though, the perfect phrase for describing what I feel about Ma.gnolia&#8217;s sign in screen. It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve had issues with over complicated log in pages (complicated in terms of how it&#8217;s built) and I dare say it won&#8217;t be the last. And just like last time I posted on this topic, I&#8217;m expecting that I&#8217;ll get comments that will range from &quot;You&#8217;re right, this is way over complicating the process - have they not heard of web standards?&quot;, through &quot;It&#8217;s actually very hard to build sites that use progressive enhancement propely without massive amounts of code forking&quot; to &quot;stop blaming frameworks&quot;. But please read on before heading straight to the comments. [...]</description>

		<description>Ian, you bring up a good point regarding JavaScript development. Just because a function doesn&#039;t get called doesn&#039;t mean JavaScript is disabled. Its not just JavaScript is enabled or its disabled, but

1.) JavaScript is enabled and the js gets executed
2.) JavaScript is enabled but the JavaScript file doesn&#039;t reach the browser
3.) JavaScript is disabled.

Blogger can easily solve circumstance 2 by always having a submit button (not stuck inside a noscript element).

The company security policy where you work is also part of the problem. I understand why the policy is like that. To be honest, that&#039;s not Blogger&#039;s problem - but - scenario 2.) can happen in other ways other than a corporate security policy, so it makes sense for Blogger to cater for it.

Reminds me of a time when some bright spark decided to filter out all banner ads as part of a corporate security measure. Had the marketing department hitting the roof since there was no way of testing whether the banner ads they&#039;d just paid for were working. The &quot;security measure&quot; lasted for oh, about half-a-day before it was quietly pulled.</description>
