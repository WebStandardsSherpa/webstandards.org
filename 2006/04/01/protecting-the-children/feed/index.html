		<description>I am personally concerned about the Cascading part of CSS... I fear getting hit on the head by a cascading bit of style sheet. Is there any safety mechanism out there that can prevent serious injury or death related to improper storage of style sheets? I’m sure OSHA may have some guidelines for proper implementation of sharp brackets in HTML and proper bracing and tie downs to prevent untimely cascading of style sheets. I hope the WaSP’s will be looking into these dangerous problems more in the future. I’ll be wearing my hardhat until they come up with a solution.</description>

		<description>[...] WaSP is most concerned about the safety of children and is proposing a new markup specification (CHTML) with rounded parentheses instead of dangerous angle brackets, among other recommendations. I&#8217;d like to see the recommendations go further, though, and involve the participation of the DOM Scripting Task Force and the Royal Horticultural Society (arboreal division) to make safety guidelines for climbing the document tree.

		<description>Ha ha. I got poked in the eye by a curly brace in a 3d game engine written in C++ but do I cry - of course I do... :)

Sharp braces are the last defensive weapon we have against having just anyone code web pages (Sorry TBL)... honest. Danger is my middle name you know. The name&#039;s Pig, Norty Pig (that&#039;s kind of like James Bond when you read it).

[OK I&#039;ve never bothered to look in a game engine&#039;s code lol]</description>
