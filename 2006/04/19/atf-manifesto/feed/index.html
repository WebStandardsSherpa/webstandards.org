		<description>&quot;Better automated testing tools (for WCAG at least).&quot;

That misses the point of what web accessibility is about - removing barrier we create that present problems for people. The key fundamental concept is its about people - not technology. WCAG is written on the basis of problems people with disabilities face when using the web. You cannot factor out the human element, and as a result, &quot;better automated testing tools&quot; cannot cover any major portion of any accessibility guidelines.

Ignore the human aspect, and you ignore what it is to be accessible. People are not robots, so an automated tool cannot succeed in detecting or highlighting barrier to access.

Relying on automated tools for accessibility is harmful. Better automated tools do nothing to remove or lessen the proper usability and accessibility testing with disabled people or the thought required by an experienced web developer. Automated tools are not the solution - they only redefine the problem to suit themselves.</description>

		<description>Mike, yes, AT vendors are in fact at the top of our priority list. And that goes beyond screen readers, but also includes magnifiers and alls sorts of other assistive technologies (including web browsers itself - anyone remember UAAG?). We are at a point where AT sometimes better understands tag soup and chokes on proper markup, so this needs to be fixed also from a user perspective. Having to restart yout AT because an author did the right thing doesn&#039;t help selling the idea of web standards.
And the research brothercake &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=4682&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;posted over at the accessifyforum&lt;/a&gt; has a chilling effect, yes - we&#039;re looking into that as well, watch this space.
Regarding MSAA - there&#039;s a tool from Microsoft that outputs what is passed through MSAA. You&#039;ll be amazed how much information is in there that actually never makes it out of the speaker or onto the braille keyboard.</description>

		<description>Matt, and all the members of the Accessibility Task Force, the Manifesto is a great start, full of promise, optimism, and more importantly, full of passion. I&#039;m heartened to see that what&#039;s been lined out above complements and highlights the key portions of PAS 78 (from a web developer perspective).

You have my full support. And good luck! I look forward to working alongside you in the future.

In terms of who to approach first, definitely the assistive technology vendors. They need to start working with us to deliver an accessible experience. Granted they&#039;ve previously had to do a lot of work trying to hack their way through tag-soup, we are delivering markup that&#039;s superior in terms of semantics, structure, and accessibility cues, so we are offering them product features which should be easier to implement - for example list navigation, header outlining, table summaries, abbreviations.

At the high end, DOM support is particularly important - brothercake has highlighted inconsistencies through to inaccessibilities with simple AJAX scripts which update the DOM dynamically. screen readers need to work with DOM and events to ensure the content updated there is available to their users.

The web standards are there, and I think firstly we need to understand why assistive technologies don&#039;t fully support them. What problems are they having trying to support web standards and websites built from web standards - are the browsers creating a problem that needs to be addresses -in the case of Windows-bases assistive technology,  is MSAA not supplying the proper DOM information through to them, does the specification not make sense or is it impractical? Certainly we need to encourage them to bring their tools into compliance.</description>
