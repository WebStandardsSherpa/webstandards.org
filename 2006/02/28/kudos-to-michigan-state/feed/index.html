		<description>I WOULD congratulate MSU on their nice redesign, IF it weren&#039;t for the fact that the site is a complete rip-off of the design of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornell.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cornell.edu&lt;/a&gt;.  

It is clearly stated on this page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornell.edu/about/site/index.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cornell.edu/about/site/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;, that Cornell&#039;s current website design was established in 2004, but the similarities between cornell.edu and msu.edu are strikingly similar and there seems to be no credit given to Cornell for the idea or inspiration anywhere on MSU&#039;s website, in fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msu.edu/about.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; seems to imply that the site is an original design, which is obviously not the case.

Bad form, MSU, bad form.</description>

		<description>Congratualations to Michigan State University for putting together a fabulous website. Just ran the site thru the W3 validator and it passed with no problems. The people over there have alot to be proud of and this is just another great example from Michigan State University and I hope the none compliant schools look to this and see there school needs to be web standards compliant as well.</description>

		<description>Congratulations to Michigan State University on their great new website. As the webmaster of a British institution that has itself recently launched a standards compliant and accessible website, I know what a fun job it is to get the necessary buy-in from Vice Chancellors, Directors and Heads of Schools.  Here&#039;s hoping that the WaSP Education Task Force can persuade more educational bodies to follow suit.</description>
