		<description>I know most of us have little pull, if any, with the W3, but the root of the problem is them. What can we do to speed W3′s adoption of design principles? Do we need another WHATWG?</description>

		<description>What kind of programmers is developing web browsers? When ever I do something I follow the standards. I know that the people that made the standards are probably smarter than me and that&#039;s why they did something in a way that I think is insane. 

Every programmer should have that as a rule of thumb: Follow the standards or make a standard your self.</description>

		<description>I have implemented a change in our corporate website to supporting web standards browsers with graceful degradation for all others. We have removed the browsers and browser version we support and have replaced it with a comment that simply says we support web standards browsers. 

It would be fantastic if you could provide a page with a list of browsers that are deemed by you to be compliant so that we can direct users to the list. I believe this would helpful to other large corporations as well. 

Cheers</description>

		<description>No, that&#039;s the wrong approach. Telling browser vendors to do the wrong thing because people are doing things they should not? If someone isn&#039;t doing their job competently they either correct their actions or they should eventually get fired. Only using the WebKit prefix shows that the person generating the code is incompetent. Two wrongs don&#039;t make a right.</description>

		<description>Really a informative post. I agreed that most of designers and developers are understanding the root problem is important to theorize a more permanent solutions.</description>

		<description>Whether you like Vendor Prefixes or not, we have a problem. Due to the rise in mobile browser usage, and many of those mobile browsers being based on WebKit, many developers have decided to essentially only use the -webkit- prefix, even for properties that have been implemented by other browsers. Today Daniel Glazman, W3C CSS Working Group Co-chairman, wrote a blog post</description>

		<description>FWIW I&#039;ve committed change proposals to the SVN repository that holds all the SPIP galaxy (CMS, plugins, templates).

http://zone.spip.org/trac/spip-zone/changeset/59092

Message in French reads:
+/*
+
+    ATTENTION
+    L&#039;usage de proprietes -webkit-* sans leurs contreparties
+    (-o-*, -moz-*, etc.) est fortement deconseille !
+    cf. http://www.webstandards.org/2012/02/09/call-for-action-on-vendor-prefixes/
+
+    Prenez le temps de corriger s&#039;il vous plait : les proprietes CSS prefixees ne sont en theorie
+    destinees qu&#039;a des fins de test.
+
+*/

Which means: BEWARE: using -webkit-* properties without any counterpart is strongly not recommended. Take the time to correct please: prefixed CSS properties are only theoretically for testing purposes.

All in all the SPIP community is very respectful of diversity: out of several tens of thousands of files, I found only a dozen lonely -webkit-* rules. :)</description>
