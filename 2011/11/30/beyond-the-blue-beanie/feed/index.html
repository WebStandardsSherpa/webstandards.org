		<description>&quot;But I’m just a single developer…
I don’t have an organization behind me…
The company I work for doesn’t really care…
I can’t really effect anything, why bother…&quot;

All of us can make a difference and I commend you on your efforts.

		<description>I think its great that you fight for a simple, affordable access to web technologies for everyone. To be honest, I&#039;m no developer but I will check out the &quot;Move the Web Forward&quot; Website.
I think I&#039;m more like the down to earth guy. But I think exactly there the fight for open source technologies just started. I watched this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEMkvT0DEk about &quot;Open Source Blueprints for Civilization&quot; and thought that is kinda similar to the Webstandarts project, isn&#039;t it? Its about providing offline technology to everyone who needs it. I thought that might interest you. I think I will try to help there a little bit. Had a hard time to understand their Website, so I thought I could help them to make it more user friendly.

Oh and I have a question, where do I get this cool blue hat? I could need a few. I know many developers and I think it would make great gifts. ;-)</description>

		<description>I think you have a very good point, everybody can do something if he / she wants too. I will forward this article to some of our developers and marketing people, I&#039;m sure they can get some awareness out of it.</description>
