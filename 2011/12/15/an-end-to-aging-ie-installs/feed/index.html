		<description>Do I hear correctly? Is that the sound of millions of IE6 voices suddenly cried out in terror and were silenced?

Just in case, don&#039;t forget rule number 2: double tap. Microsoft, maybe you need to put one more &quot;bullet&quot; into IE6, just to keep it under ground.</description>

		<description>Hey Aaron, this is something to celebrate, no question. Save, I&#039;ve got to step in and ask politely, why use Grandma‽ If &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; Grandma is what you hand in mind, then by all means, use Grandma Gustafson.</description>

		<description>IE6 has been the vain of my life. I&#039;m a web developer and am constantly asked to make sites work for IE6. Transparent PNG don&#039;t display properly. Javascript behaves differently, and CSS shows up totally different to any other browser, even IE7.

I think it&#039;s a case of microsoft trying to set their own web-standard and not following W3C in the was the other major browser do.</description>
