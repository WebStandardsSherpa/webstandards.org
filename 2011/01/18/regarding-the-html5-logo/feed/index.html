		<description>I think the logo is a good idea. To me its marketing 101 and even an open technology needs marketing to quicken the adaptation.</description>

		<description>It is one thing to make an HTML logo to act as a general symbol, akin to the RSS symbol. It is another to try to establish supremacy in terms of who owns what technology. That is what is happening here, I think.</description>

		<description>You know something, if we need a name for name sake - instead of HTML5 like W3C has come out with, why not &quot;WAKA&quot;/&quot;Web AKA&quot; or &quot;Web Also Known As&quot; 

Its the web that uses various technologies... Just a thought...

Good letter tho.

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We [developers] never needed a term to refer to “XHTML 1.0 plus CSS2.1” or “HTML4.01 plus JavaScript” or “any combination of front-end technologies.” Why this sudden all-conquering need for a term that covers so many different technologies as to be completely meaningless?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Does &quot;three-legged stool&quot; ring any bells?</description>
