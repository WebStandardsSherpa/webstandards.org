		<description>Great post.  As my grandma used to say, &quot;we all gotta pick our battles&quot;.  Like the last posters comments about why they may have picked this battle.  At the end of the day, it won&#039;t accomplish much, where as focusing energy on across the board standards, like ya&#039;ll do, that makes good sense.  Communication between humans is hard enough, we need systems and formats that make it easier to get on the same page!</description>

		<description>It&#039;s at a minimal a marketing stunt and none of the reasons the excessive number of large words add up mathematically speaking for removing the version number; it really seems to come down to from what I&#039;ve read that the WHATWG had mild to harsh disagreements with the W3C and decided to take their own route. It&#039;s a symbolic move to say they work on &quot;HTML&quot; instead of HTML5 as in the idea that they have taken over all of the work on HTML as a whole (e.g. HTML 1~5) thus somehow superseding the W3C.

I&#039;m still calling HTML5 HTML5 because that&#039;s what it is. People will still use HTML 4.01 and 3.2 in example long in to the lifespan and beyond HTML5 and 6. Removing the number doesn&#039;t serve any useful technical functionality or benefit.</description>
