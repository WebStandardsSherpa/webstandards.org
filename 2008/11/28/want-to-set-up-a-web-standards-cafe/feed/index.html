		<description>Chinese have a lack of high quality translated resources for web standards developers to reference. All valid. Another large part of that issue is the cultural and semantic differences between the language and people, which means not only literal translations of websites and resources but also some low level repurposing.</description>

Another large part of that issue is the cultural and semantic differences between the language and people, which means not only literal translations of websites and resources but also some low level repurposing. And, when you really think of it, these are also subject to political oversight - consider John Oxton&#8217;s Joshuaink a few years ago. Web standards resources may not all be smiles and culturally polite cafe conversation. [...]</description>
