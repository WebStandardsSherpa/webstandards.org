		<description>Beside all complaints that the WCAG 2 itself isn&#039;t accessible for all developers, this document should be added as well: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/
Sooner or later web developers have to deal with it, this is beyond question. Thus I appreciate to inform developers how to manage the switch to WCAG 2.0. 
But I really wonder why something that aims to ease peoples life has to be so complicated?</description>

		<description>Of course, Paul: good point. So I&#039;ve started off a list of &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/11/06/wcag-20-resources/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recommended WCAG 2 resources&lt;/a&gt; for the community to build.

Thanks for suggesting it.</description>

Your clients might start asking about WCAG 2 though.</description>
