		<description>It´s really beautiful and useful as well. There are so many great browsers and the IE8 will be nothing more than a bad copy of the best ideas from the other developers. It´s twisted, because on the one hand Microsofts likes to sell it as their own inventions then, on the other hand the most &quot;normal&quot; webusers are to lazy to install a good browser. So Opera 9.5 is in my eyes, although I just fell in love with FF3.</description>

		<description>I haven&#039;t used Opera for quite some time, and I must say that this new skin is awesome. I also love the &quot;Paste and Go&quot; feature that Opera has. I just might switch to this from Firefox...

Good job, Opera people.</description>

		<description>One of the new features that I like in Opera 9.5 lets you “find anything” on a previously browsed web page. Using the “Quick Find” feature, you only need to remember a word from a page you’ve read earlier, entering it into the address bar to bring up a list of pages with matching text, so you won’t need to hunt through your ‘history’ list to find that missing page once more. In addition a favorite item added in Opera 9.5 is the “Opera Link”. This ensures that your bookmarks, your “Speed Dial” of most accessed sites and notes (such as directions, shopping lists or any other notes) you’ve taken in the Opera browser “can follow you anywhere” - you can access Opera Link information through Opera Mini on your mobile phone.</description>

		<description>AWESOME!! Opera will always be the no.1 for me! I started using the mini on my N95 cell phone, and eventually switched to opera from FF.
I&#039;m dying to see which one will be my new favorite O9.5 or FF3</description>
