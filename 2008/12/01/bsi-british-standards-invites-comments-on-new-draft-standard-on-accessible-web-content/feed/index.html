		<description>As a web developer there is several areas that I feel are key to the BSI 8878 that go beyond PAS 78 and WCAG. No longer can web developers rely upon automated tools to see if a website is accessible. This I believe too is only half the battle.</description>

		<description>I think defacto standards which allow all websites to conform and make the internet accessible for disabled users can only be a wonderful thing.
The internet has had a phenominal effect on the world and it seems only fair we put in place measures so everyone can benefit as equally as possible.</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t imagine that BSI will make the final standard free as they are a commercial organisation, however I am prepared to be pleasantly surprised and eat my hat if I am wrong about that.</description>

I raised this with the beeb, and they were gracious enough to say (I paraphrase), &quot;Oops.&quot;</description>

		<description>We might expect the much-touted BBC My Web My Way to be a paragon of accessibility.

So &quot;Skip to content&quot; should skip over common stuff like navigation menus, and go to the page&#039;s distinct content.

		<description>This announcement doesn&#039;t actually say where, or how, to get the draft standard. I suggest making it clear, near the top of the announcement where the draft can be obtained. There is a link near the bottom for getting it in PDF or Word format, but I can&#039;t imagine that BSI would be silly enough to not offer the standard in HTML.

Also it is not made clear if the standard will be made available for free online. If the standard is going to be document which the reader has to pay for then it will not be widely read.

I suggest BSI adopt W3C&#039;s processes and simply provide the standard online in HTML format for anyone to read for free. To do otherwise is a waste of time and effort.</description>

		<description>I came across this document by chance and I think it&#039;s great work! Getting these standards are more widely spread and included in authoring software is important. Keep up the great work!</description>

		<description>I will be contacting Julie Howell direct.  I have contacted her several times before to discuss issues.  Julie Howell has MS (Multiple Sclerosis) and has campaigned and promoted awareness to MS as well as web accessibility.

As a web developer there is several areas that I feel are key to the BSI 8878 that go beyond PAS 78 and WCAG. No longer can web developers rely upon automated tools to see if a website is accessible. This I believe is only half the battle.

Web standards can solve problem with  the seperation of content from style and layout which needs to be clearly defined in the new guidelines. For example colour balance for visually impaired or colour blind uses. 

Even today there are websites that are classed as WCAG AA complient that use light grey text on a white background or even green text on a lime green background which is difficult even for a non visually impaired user to read regardless of font size.</description>
