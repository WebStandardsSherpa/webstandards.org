		<description>As a web designer/developer, I visit the W3C web site for reference almost daily, whether to check syntax for my web pages or to validate code. I am honored to donate to the project.</description>

		<description>Thats a good idea to come up with a donation program. I wanted to support them before, but their memberships are way to expensive for me.</description>

		<description>As pointed out in the W3C&#039;s information, there are other ways to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Status#contribute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt; to the validator program. If you have the expertise to help code or test the validators, you&#039;ll be supporting the tools which are probably the most commonly used by developers worldwide.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not sure how I feel about giving to an organization that hasn&#039;t been overly transparent about where the money goes. If the W3C wasn&#039;t so slow about nearly everything they do, I might consider giving. But as wortwart points out, there are other better services out there. While I would rather use a validator written by the people who write the specifications but if they can&#039;t keep up then well too bad for them. Come on W3C get with it.</description>

		<description>I see no point in supporting the W3C HTML validator which has had trouble with XHTML and has been (or still is, I don&#039;t know) inaccurate. I rather use Validome.org&#039;s service.</description>

		<description>We support W3C and just made a donation to this wonderful program. We hope that all the readers will contribute to this cause in order for the free validators to be available for all.</description>
