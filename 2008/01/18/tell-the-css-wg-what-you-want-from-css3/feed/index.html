		<description>i could need a pseudo-class that select evey even child in an element for exaple a table:

table:evenchild{backgroundcolor:grey}



this one has a grey bg

this one has a grey bg

this one has a grey bg



ans so on...

it would be possible to crate tables with alternating backgroundcolors like this http://www.innoq.com/blog/phaus/table.before.png</description>

		<description>Everyone is coming with great ideas and if all this is developed in CSS3, it&#039;ll be great.

But I&#039;m more concerned about HOW you will implement these features. Will you add yet another way to do things we already do ?
Please don&#039;t. 
I agree with David Storey.

If I want a complex gradient, please let me point (xpath, xpointer) to the corresponding gradient in an svg document.
If I want an animation, please let me use SMIL.
If I want a filter effect (blur, shadow, noise, ...), please let me point my svg again.

Thanks heaps !</description>

		<description>Back in 2004 I expressed a need for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bernzilla.com/item.php?id=142&quot; title=&quot;Ignoring All Styles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ignoring all styles&lt;/a&gt; for a page element regardless of any other normal styling rules that might have normally been applied due to inheritance, etc.  If there&#039;s a way to do this currently, I&#039;d be interested in knowing.  If there isn&#039;t, then it would be cool to see it considered for CSS3.</description>

		<description>I&#039;d really appreciate those &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.opera.com/dstorey/blog/2007/11/14/css4-selectors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nth-word selectors.&lt;/a&gt;

And maybe an nth-letter selector, which could be used in conjunction with web fonts to create some really nice effects.

Also, could you add back in the :indeterminate pseudo-class? That would help users more easily see which options they haven&#039;t selected yet.

ex.
input[type=radio]:indeterminate + label:after {
  content:&quot; Select One&quot;;
}</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve blogged some review and ideas at &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/03#day05&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What Ben Millard would like from &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets Level 3&quot;&gt;CSS3&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A lot more than I had planned to, actually.

Main things from my perspective as an author are:


 widespread implementation of useful stuff from &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets Level 2&quot;&gt;CSS2&lt;/acronym&gt;;
 avoiding a proliferation of features which all do very similar things in &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets Level 3&quot;&gt;CSS3&lt;/acronym&gt;;
 and making &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets Level&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/acronym&gt; easier for authors.

		<description>I&#039;m going to admit to myself I&#039;m not going to have time to read over the layout module before Saturday but I saw a demo that Andy Clarke did of the bit about the slots and it worries me.  It seems really unmaintainable.

Not having read it myself there is one thing that I thought would improve it though it may already be part of it:

Not having to define the slots in alphabetical order a.b.c.  For example could also be a.f.m.  That would make it much easier to make a.a.a.a.a.a.b.c.d.e.f into a.a.a.a.s.s.b.c.d.e.f without having to redefine a-f.</description>

		<description>Ah, I just remembered the problem I&#039;ve been wanting calculations to try to solve.

With the standard box model there&#039;s no way to have to divs that are each 50% of the screen AND have padding, margin, or border.  There isn&#039;t, in fact, a way to style anything an accurate percentage width of the screen and give it padding, margin, or border.

In an ideal world we could say:
#box{
width:50% -20px;
border:10px;
}

There are actually two other solutions to this particular problem.  Setting the box model:

#box{
width:50%;
box-sizing: border-box;
border:10px;
}

Or being able to dynamically define an inner box like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstandards.org/2008/01/18/tell-the-css-wg-what-you-want-from-css3/#comment-59529&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comment #31&lt;/a&gt; suggested:
#box{
width:50%;
}
#box:inner{
border:10px;
}

Thanks again.</description>

		<description>Hello...

Wouldn&#039;t it be neat if we could have variables in CSS3?

For example you define a variable called my_color (and the syntax could be similar to PHP - with a $ before the variable name)

$my_color: &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;;

and then in the code you just use it like this

border: 1px solid $my_color;
background-color: $my_color;


It would be much easier to maintain the website with just changing the variable value (if you decide to change the color for example) then to change each induvidual value every time...



Another suggestion - will vertical alignment be possible in CSS3?</description>
