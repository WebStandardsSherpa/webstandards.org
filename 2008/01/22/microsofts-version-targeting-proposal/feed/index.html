		<description>I&#039;m shocked we are going backwards so fast here... Why did I spend the last 7 years of my life developing my standards compliance skills when in the blink of an eye it will suddenly be all for nothing?

I simply cannot and will not support this idea! The sites I create are standards compliant, they work in all of the major standards compliant  web browsers, they require some small tweaks using conditional comments to render correctly in IE5 and up. If this new IE8 browser has the spec right why should I be forced to insert a meta tag to allow that spec to be implemented?

If IE8 has the spec right I would expect my sites to continue to render correctly, my tweaks will remain for lesser versions of IE. I can&#039;t support the opt-in/out meta solution, but if there is no other way, don&#039;t penalise the developers who are doing the right thing, penalise those that aren&#039;t. 

Sadly I must say I have suddenly lost a lot of respect for a small portion of prominent people who have for so long lead the way in the web standards movement due to their support for this proposal, there is only one way they will ever earn that respect back now, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;dump this BS proposal&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; for the love of everything you worked so hard for.</description>

		<description>Microsoft are trying to fix a problem that doesn&#039;t exist - every major corporate body that I know of have locked their desktop&#039;s off at IE6, because IE7 breaks so many (Microsoft based) intranets. A rendering mode in IE8 that only goes back as far as IE7 is not going to be any use to these kinds of people. Presumably Vista won&#039;t support IE6, so that is a shot in their other foot!</description>

		<description>I have mixed opinions on this, but in general why dont they make the browser versioning part of the DOCTYPE tag to avoid further degrading its importance? I understand that making it a meta you can add it to the header and all, but they are making a simple solution way more complicated than it has to be. If the version is in the DOCTYPE... use it, if not assume its and old school DOCTYPE standards pre- IE8.</description>

		<description>It should be pointed out that as of March 8, 2007, Microsoft’s net worth as a company was $267.53 Billion (USD). So here’s a company that has had hundreds of billions of dollars and several years to address this issue and THIS is the best it can do? Hmm. 

Years ago, they could’ve afforded to hire every single one of the brightest minds on the planet - minds that probably could’ve entirely re-written the buggy browser from scratch in a few months time, had it chosen to do so. Again, Hmm. 

So they’ve had the money, the time and the opportunity to fix things. With some thought, doesn’t it become rather obvious that they are most likely CHOOSING non-compliance? 

This would keep intranet and legacy app users locked in to their current IE stranglehold for the foreseeable future. 

Microsoft is a company that has never chosen compliancy. And this has been a DELIBERATE choice all the way, right down the line. 

And they NEVER WILL, or they would’ve done so by now.

By far the most disturbing aspect of this IE8 debate is that some developers and organizations who in the past have made standards compliance such high a priority have now thrown their reputations aside in order to back this hack.

People and groups that have announced their support of Microsoft on this issue can no longer truly consider themselves advocates of standards compliance. You can’t have it both ways. Standards are standards, whether it’s for Microsoft or Mozilla.

Anyway, here’s my suggestion: Since Microsft has chosen this course (with everyone else paying the bill), let’s put the onus on them to handle the breakage when it occurs. 

They should put a big red button on the main toolbar of IE8 with the message: “Having trouble viewing this site?”. 

In which case a “Yes” reply would revert the browser back to IE7, or 6, or 5, or whatever ancient version they choose to keep people locked in to.</description>

		<description>I like many others see this as a valiant effort by the current IE development team to fix the bed that Microsoft made for itself. However, I also see this as a terrible idea which will in the end only reinforce the dominance of IE/Microsoft in dictating what will and will not be standard.

The solution that everyone keeps asking for is actually very simple. However, it is one that Microsoft themselves have to create. The solution is to simply not intertwine IE8 into the Windows operating system like bone cancer in a person. If they were to make IE8 a separated app then those big, slow, dinosaur companies with intranets that require IE6 could keep IE6 for their intranets and &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; run IE8 without this proprietary markup for the internet.

So, the solution is simple. Microsoft will have to make a sacrifice now for their past actions. I know it is completely unAmerican to expect a company to pay for their past deeds, but that is the right solution to this.

They caused this whole mess with their despicable actions in the 90s so now they should shoulder the burden for fixing it in their software not our standards.</description>

		<description>@Mr. Talbot.

I do understand your position. However, since unknown doctypes will trigger Full Standards Mode in IE8, I conclude this mode is the default.

The old - or known - doctypes are the real opt-out while the meta-element is an additional opt-in.

And according to Chros Wilson, it may have been the last time an additional mode was introduced.</description>

		<description>Phew, so many great comments, but whether technical, thoughtful, partisan,  from-the-heart, whatever, the fact remains: DOCTYPE will create a fork in web-standards, and a fork in the web itself. 

The very fabric of the web itself rests on Open Standards (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, you-name-it), but DOCTYPE will give Microsoft the space to do what it does best: ignore Open Standards, force us to to use IE because only IE can render web-sites properly, and hence keep Windows on the desktop so that we keep paying the Windows tax.

Guys &#039;n Gals: box hard for Open Standards! Don&#039;t let proprietary standards dictate to you.</description>

		<description>Personally, I&#039;m not happy with the idea of requiring an extra tag in my (X)HTML code just to ensure IE will display my web pages correctly.  Frankly, if a developer&#039;s pages break because the new browser is _less_ buggy than the previous version, then the developer should fix its web pages.  If the developer has been following proper web standards, but has to use various hacks to work around specific brands of browser&#039;s bugs then maybe the developer should rewrite its pages so that they&#039;re less convoluted (KISS)!

Anyhow, if Microsoft is so worried about this then maybe they should try this out: If a web page has a DOCTYPE declaration, but has errors, or has a missing/malformed DOCTYPE then not only revert to quirks mode, but offer to render the page in IEn-m engine.  

Let IE8 render web pages in Standards mode by default.  Don&#039;t make conscientious web developers and competing browser developers shoulder the burden of correcting Microsoft&#039;s mistakes.</description>
