		<description>I have to say whomever wrote that headline should be working at a newspaper writing headlines instead of spending their time checking code. Quite catchy for a developer.</description>

When I removed the last trailing slash from the URL manually, it worked. Just thought I&#039;d let you know...</description>

		<description>The builds since Opera 9.5 beta pass the test fully (without the green lines).  More importantly to the test, the upcoming Opera Mobile 9.5 beta also passes the test.  Unfortunately Opera Mini doesn&#039;t.  It uses the same engine but doesn&#039;t yet support SVG for efficiency reasons.  I&#039;m not sure why it fails the application/xhtml+xml test though.  Probably something to do with the iframe.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I will only believe it when IE renders and handles a button-tag correctly and doesn’t try to save application/xml local.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Um... you will only believe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; when IE does that? What has that even got to do with any of this?</description>

		<description>Interesting that Mobile safari on Nokia S60 passes the dynamic SVG test whereas desktop safari doesn&#039;t. What does it mean if the square is green but has a little white &#039;+&#039; symbol in the corner?

Incidentally this is the first time I&#039;ve been able to use a QR code to save rather than waste time!</description>

		<description>&gt; green squares are desirable, the red squares mean a feature isn’t yet supported

That’s a relief. I seem to remember something on the Safari blog about one developer sending another a test page for an Acid3-related bug, and the guy spent ages trying to stop it displaying a red square, when that was actually the success indicator.

My iPhone Safari gets 3 red squares.</description>

		<description>I know it&#039;s not meant for desktop browsers, but perhaps the results are interesting when you try the mobile test on them. In the result I used a matrix counting left to right to indicate the squares:

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

The results are:

Opera 9.5 (Beta) - all green squares! But some red lines showing behind some.

Firefox 2 - mostly green. Red squares at positions 8, 9 and 12.

Firefox 3 (Beta 5) - same as Firefox 2, except squares 11 and 12 are not as tall as the rest.

IE8 - only the top line is green, the rest is red. Square 5 is missing altogether, and the browser tries to download an XHTML file at one point. Sigh!

Safari 3.1 - all green except square 9!</description>
