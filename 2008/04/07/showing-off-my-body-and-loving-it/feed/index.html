		<description>Interesting idea: HTML without CSS, but it is not realy normal, because every value in html-tag - it is analogue of CSS (mayby reverse: every CSS-value - analogue of html-tag-parametter ). It is like present world without mathematic ;-)</description>

		<description>I think that it is irrelevant whether &lt;abbr title=&quot;The Web Standards Project&quot;&gt;WaSP&lt;/abbr&gt; goes naked or not; as trovster said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstandards.org/2008/04/07/showing-off-my-body-and-loving-it/#comment-70479&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comment #1&lt;/a&gt;, it will only be a case of preaching to the converted anyway.
I went naked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdclark.org/&quot; title=&quot;The personal website of Jordan Clark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; for the day, and I think I converted my &quot;audience&quot; (&lt;abbr title=&quot;that is&quot;&gt;i.e.&lt;/abbr&gt;: my mother&#039;s behind me all the way!)
What I&#039;m trying to say is: to really get the point across to the masses, you need the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/ncr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to get on board... then again, some things are best left covered up!</description>

		<description>What I don&#039;t understand is that the WASP site looks awesome without styles. It&#039;s an inspiration to people who wonder how they could possibly present a style-free version of their own site.</description>

		<description>Very disappointed to find you didn&#039;t &#039;strip&#039; for naked day.... very weak....

Yes, I agree - it would have a huge effect on all those visiting the site - I thought that was the point???

I don&#039;t think anyone would have objected to a solution similar to the one on the &#039;friends of ed&#039; site - a styled box with the site&#039;s menu contained within the unstyled page. This allowed anyone to access the links as they are used  to - but made a very string point due to the page being otherwise unstyled...

This approach could have worked for the WaSP site as well - not taking part at all does feel like a huge let down, in my opinion.....</description>

		<description>Okay, so you don&#039;t practice what you preach. I think I&#039;ve seen as much of this website as I need to.</description>

		<description>Personally I think the whole point of CSS Naked Day is that yes, you DO need to explain it to people. If people understood it, there wouldn&#039;t be much need for it.

Frankly I think it&#039;s a bit weak for WaSP to opt out &lt;strong&gt;because it would have to educate people about web standards&lt;/strong&gt;. Sorry to be blunt, but isn&#039;t that what you&#039;re here for? Showing the site without CSS &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; witnessing POSH and progressive enhancement in action.

Yes, WaSP would need to run the &quot;where is the design?&quot; block at the top of the page - like any number of participating sites. But with that explanation in place, surely all would be well?

While I really do see the point that some sites don&#039;t have enough to gain from CSS Naked Day, I don&#039;t think WaSP is one of those sites.</description>

		<description>I agree...I think that it may not make sense for a majority of sites to do this, but for those of us that can - then why not? It&#039;s a simple way to get a little recognition, and if nothing else it might make people ask the question &quot;Hey, what&#039;s wrong with your site?&quot;. Then you have a reason to explain it to them. I personally see no harm.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t get naked for the same reason. I have six sites and it&#039;d be a poor decision for four of them, I&#039;d be able to get away with it on two, but I won&#039;t even do it to my portfolio (linked from my name) and Accessites because I just feel too many visitors wouldn&#039;t understand and I&#039;d have to explain, etc. I&#039;d rather just write an article about it then those curious can turn off styles and check it (and be more than satisfied) for themselves.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m looking forward to gettin&#039; naked by shedding my css and showing nothin&#039; but deliciously semantic mark-up.  Reminds me of when I look in the mirror with no make-up on and love the bare bones me.</description>
