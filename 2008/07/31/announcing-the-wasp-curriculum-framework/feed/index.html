		<description>Its a good approach and good idea overall. I read ETF curriculum survey results. I agree with a few things faculty shortages, sickness as well is an issue as lectures are cancelled. 

Problem i feel with most curriculum i feel is they all give outline, essential concepts and a few examples but they don&#039;t follow the approach for an average student to follow the curriculum and develop something of his own with little help.

For most average students large part of the curriculum goes over their head and it puts them off from further study and research. I as an ex-student and professional would advice that kind of an approach.

		<description>I want to come play!

I’ll be submitting my resume to Google in the spring, but it will be for NY Google, not Mountain View Google. We’ll see how things go.</description>

		<description>Recommending course dependencies indicating what students will need to know before beginning each course sounds like a good idea to save a lot of time.</description>

		<description>I agree with the other poster, great idea, but good luck getting Univ&#039;s to get moving on this any time soon.  Too many older people who need 55 meetings to put one foot in front of the other.  Hopefully this happens sooner rather than later.</description>

		<description>I think this is a very good aproach and absolutly necessary. Nowadays everyone can make an 	off-the-job training and call themself a Web professional. A standard will help to improve the quality of the education.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m glad this task is going to be started. I appreciate the fact that you are dealing with it. I hope, that  I will also learn something from the WaSP. 
Kind regards
