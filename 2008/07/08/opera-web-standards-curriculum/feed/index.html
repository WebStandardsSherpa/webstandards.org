		<description>I note that the Opera-team and Yahoo-team assembled cool materials. They can be safely produce training materials for educational institutions. Personally, I learned quite a lot, with such nuances, which allows earlier passing attention. Recently, I got 2 Labour stepped in knowledge: The Web Standards Curriculum and Designing With Web Standards by Zeldman.

Guys, Let&#039;s Continue!

		<description>(with my Opera employee hat on) The first tranche of articles is largely focussed on markup, and we have another 27 or so in the editing process. Many of those cover CSS. None of them are written by Håkon&#8212;but then, what does he know about CSS anyway?  ;-)</description>

		<description>Great to see this is being developed and worked on by Opera.  I just started to go through it.  It would be nice, as Dominic, says to add some css to it, but if the goal was simply web standards, it seems to tackle those issues pretty well.</description>

maybe for the CSS section

		<description>This is awesome! I run a small web team and not a single new recruit has ever had any training in proper development methodologies, despite the fact that we only hire people with so-called qualifications in web design.

I&#039;ll start to use this in my on-the-job training.</description>

		<description>This seems to be a good jump-start for beginners and maybe intermediate students if you don&#039;t know where to bite first - or next, that is.</description>
