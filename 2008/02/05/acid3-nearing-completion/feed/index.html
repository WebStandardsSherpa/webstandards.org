		<description>Reposting from the first Acid3 posting:

OS X.4.11

Latest Webkit Nightly Build (r31307) (with Safari 3.1 installed, but not used) now gets 96/100

Safari 3.1 gets 75/100 linktest failed

They’ve also just introduced an optimization into Webkit nightlies for pageloading that is very sweet on script heavy pages.
http://webkit.org/blog/166/optimizing-page-loading-in-web-browser/

“The latest WebKit nightlies contain some new optimizations to reduce the impact of network latency. When script loading halts the main parser, we start up a side parser that goes through the rest of the HTML source to find more resources to load. We also prioritize resources so that scripts and stylesheets load before images. The overall effect is that we are now able to load more resources in parallel with scripts, including other scripts.”</description>

		<description>though i did not trace too deep into the code, it seems in the step 0 (erasing the javascript requirement) you expect a indentation to appear as a text node, which is absolutely not correct and not standard behavior... the standard states clearly that white characters like line feeds and whitespaces/tabs used for indentations are ignored in the dom tree and thus a indentation should never appear as a text node between tags (btw this is a bug that firefox has for way too long and even before firefox in mozilla, and does not seem to get corrected forever, or they don&#039;t want to correct it, making us to put no indentation between tags where we want to use some dom functions like nextsibling), if you are expecting it you may want to re-read the w3c specifications and correct it

then again i repeat i did not went too deep so i can be wrong about you expecting that blank text node, but sure it does look like that

another thing i see not very well is the inclusion of svg, yes, it is standard but not something that all browser have by default, which is very very unfair, the tests should be done with technologies that every decent browser has by default, or at least warn about having the appropiate plugin before taking the test</description>

		<description>Firefox 3.0b5pre 2008032204 nightly - 71/100

Unfortunately, Firefox 3.0 final don&#039;t will beat the 100/100 rank. It&#039;s expected for 3.x or 4.0.</description>
