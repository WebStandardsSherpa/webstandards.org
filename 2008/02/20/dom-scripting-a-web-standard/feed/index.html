		<description>Nice touch if everyone got together one more time in a pub to discuss and maybe plan another project.</description>

		<description>Yeah, JavaScript and DOM have come a long way.  I remember the old DHTML days, especially Netscape 4&#039;s awful model.  Evangelism still needs to be done, however; we need consistency between implementations.</description>

I certainly think that would be a good idea and at the @media Ajax conference last November, I know that John Resig and Alex Russell were discussing this. If enough of us keeping nudging them (and other library authors), maybe this idea would get some legs.

I couldn&#039;t agree more. And is this is a discussion that occurs at the intersection of JavaScript and markup, I think it&#039;s one that will be better tackled by the WaSP as a whole rather than a JavaScript-only task force.</description>

		<description>A task-force is perhaps not needed, but there still needs to be a general education about not using inline JavaScript so that behaviour is separate from structure. I started reading PPK&#039;s book on JavaScript yesterday and it makes many important points. Yet when you go to websites there is almost no JavaScripting examples that &lt;em&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; use inline event handling. As a result the one JavaScript on my website is still using inline event handling, because until I finish reading PPK&#039;s book I can&#039;t work out how to do it properly.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

		<description>Isn&#039;t it time for a standard API for JavaScript libraries? It would make life so much easier if UI elements and the complete &#039;windowing&#039; system could be made a standard. We could start with bridge tools, and eventually all library writers would comply. Look at all the common elements: Event, Window, Document, Class, Element, Drag, Slider, Tooltip, Ajax, Date, Calendar...</description>

		<description>I’m curious to know what Blair Ballmer would look like.

On second thoughts, maybe I don’t want to know.</description>
