		<description>MS should release two browsers, 

1. IE 8 which has backward compatibility with IE 7
2. A new browser that is fully standard compliant and is like Opera, Firefox and other browsers. 

This will address the issues of both IE only (intranet) sites/applications and standards compliant sites/applications.</description>

		<description>This sounds like a sure fire way to make designing seem easier. However, by IE 1000 would this not become an extremely bulky application with supporting for the previous browsers?</description>

		<description>Well, it is hard for me to take WaSP seriously in the fight for better webstandards-support. It seems, you are more and more flirting with Microsoft rather than discussing the best way to improve their products. That&#039;s a shame. I can say for myself, that the German Webkrauts won&#039;t fall in love with one browser vendor. We are in favor of webstandards. I hope, you will soon get to the right track back again. It would be a shame if we would loose WaSP in our struggle for webstandards.</description>

		<description>I agree that &lt;strong&gt;strict doctypes should trigger IE8 standards mode, without requiring a meta tag&lt;/strong&gt;.
Opting-in should be for IE 7 &quot;standards&quot; mode; default rendering mode should be super-standards IE8 mode.

&lt;blockquote&gt;yes, a layout breaks; it can be detrimental, in most cases, not so horrible. It may not look quite right, or something may be out of alignment, or something like that.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Aaron G.

By itself, the IE bugs do not indicate how and by how much a layout will break in a given webpage. If there is a IE bug with border and my bordered box is 1px wide, I may not even notice the layout breakage or the bug. But the problem is that sometimes/often, people do all kinds of weird things with borders (like a faux-column) and then their CSS columnar webpage template breaks because of such bug.

Another issue. Many sites are over-constraining, over-coding, over-declaring, over-defining (with their CSS code and markup code), overly rigid and very much pixel-precision focused, oriented. So, then, a small layout breakage caused &lt;strong&gt;by a bug or bug fix&lt;/strong&gt; brings shouts, cries, howls, unfair finger-pointing to IE 8 for breaking up a page.

Sometimes, the breakage may be just a few pixels but it nevertheless ruins the whole design. I can show you such cases where most web designers would go mad. Just a few pixels off can break a drop-down menu list, a CSS columnar webpage template, etc.

What is still unacceptable is the &lt;strong&gt;number of very damaging bugs&lt;/strong&gt; that cause important, severe, grave problems &lt;strong&gt;in IE 7&lt;/strong&gt;: 

- Application hangs exists in IE 7
- Crash bugs exists in IE 7
- Peekaboo types of bugs still exists in IE 7
- Guillotine types of bugs still exists in IE 7
- Various content disappear bugs

and I know I&#039;m not exaggerating or over-reacting here. What would be illogical/crazy would be to not fix those severe, incapacitating bugs in IE7 standards mode. It would be irresponsible to do that in the name of backward-compatibility or because of a absolute, blind commitment/prime directive to &quot;not break the web&quot;. I can document and substantiate my claims here.

The discussion is still disappointing in some aspects. Mid-term and long-term planning from Microsoft. How is Microsoft going to avoid having another new browser version release crisis later... with IE 8.5 or IE 9? regarding the same problem we have today? We have no idea. The discussion may be happening again for IE 9 (or IE 8.5) because ordinary/amateur web authors can not upgrade their web design skills, don&#039;t read or write abandonware websites...

Web standards advocacy groups and web standards gurus - in articles, in tutorials, in web authoring forum discussion newsgroups - have always claim and recommended to learn, to read, to follow best coding practices. &lt;strong&gt;None of this - no plan of tech evangelization whatsoever - actually seems to be in any part of Microsoft&#039;s agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; You see at MSDN articles promoting user-agent exact string detection, not object/method support detection: a blatant-obvious error in my opinion. You see at MSDN invalid markup code, invalid CSS code, deprecated practices, wrong, incorrect practices almost everywhere, in articles and in code examples and code excerpts. And I&#039;m not even mentioning IE dev. people&#039;s own blogs or IE blog.

It&#039;s one thing to say that ordinary/amateur web authors do not or can not upgrade their web design skills, don&#039;t read or write abandonware websites. It&#039;s also completely true to say that &lt;strong&gt;MSDN articles are abandon-blah-blah, are spectacular examples of invalid markup code, blatant demonstration of web standards incoherence, blatant examples of web standards inconsequence.&lt;/strong&gt;

Once you fix the browser and once users upgrade the browser (or browser version) they use, then, the remaining thing to do is to upgrade the webpage code. Web authors are the &lt;em&gt;weakest link&lt;/em&gt; in the web standards circle principle: they were 3 years ago, they are today and they will be 3 3 years from now.

		<description>@Aleksey V lazar

I&#039;m already using application/xhtml+xml in my header on all my pages. This is only required for off-line testing anyway. The server itself determines how the page is served. I currently have the XML prolog proceeding the DOCTYPE so when IE supports true XML then my pages coded with XHTML will just need a change to the file extension. Instead of htm or html I will use xml or xhtml instead. I don&#039;t have to change the source code, just the file extension.

So yes, I am in full agreement with you, pages with

content=&quot;application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8&quot;

should by default render in IE8 standard mode.</description>

		<description>Every time I validate an XHTML 1.1 document using the W3C a warning about the document &quot;being served with the text/html Mime Type which is not a registered media type for the XHTML 1.1 Document Type.  The recommended media type for this document is: application/xhtml+xml&quot;.  I think that using application/xhtml+xml mime type as a trigger for standards mode is the best (and obvious) way to go.  This will not force any unexpected behaviour for users or developers.</description>

		<description>I seriously hope this is still a table issue and they haven&#039;t made the final decision yet, we all know there are better ways to deal with this issue, lets just hope that our opinions can alter the outcome to suit both parties, because if it only suits us we may as well give up now...

I&#039;m all for XHTML mime-type triggering standards mode, I&#039;m sure 99.9% of websites that would break under &quot;full standards compliance&quot; in IE8 will either have no DOCTYPE or they will have a HTML 4.0 loose DTD. This surly leaves the only broken sites to be those that were defined as XHTML/Strict because the author had no idea what they were doing, hence not our fault and not Microsoft&#039;s fault.

Besides that, do MS truly believe that everyone using IE^ will instantly move to IE8 as soon as its released? Ther will be plenty of time for people to fix these issues if the Strict DOCTYPE switch doesn&#039;t already do the job for them.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;        I think we should also ask if the XHTML mime-type could trigger IE8’s standards mode
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    Isn’t that a given? Why are we even having to question that?


Not a given. We&#039;ve asked Microsoft to confirm whether it will finally support application/xhtml+xml. And we asked if IE8 will then use standards mode when finding this mime-type. 

No answer. 

You would this would the simplest answer is the world to make, wouldn&#039;t you?</description>

		<description>What do they mean by breaking the web, 
What pages will be breaking?, early frontpage and dreamweaver pages. 
We need to almost do a study on the web, what pages will actually break. 
Couldnt the Browser detect whether it is a non standard web page and then go to quirks mode. 
If it ships in standards mode, the difference is layout engines, also what size would ie8 be because if it has to include Trident which is the old layout engine and then the New Layout Engine it would be extremly slow. 
If both are running at once.

What we also have to realise that older webpages always change, so it may not break the web, how many website will be broken. Statistics!!!
 Microsoft have a powerful marketing scheme could not they advertise about changing to standards mode. So that the release of ie8 people would be prepared so that they can change their sites.</description>
