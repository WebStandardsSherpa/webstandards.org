		<description>Ok, hi @ all. I think that Adobe Reader should get some more little functions. Maybe extracted from Adobe Acrobat. I have to work everyday with this &quot;good job&quot; application. There are so many people who need to work everyday with this freeware tool produced by adobe, but i think that there are some missing parts which should be included in the Reader. At the very least, Adobe should create a small business solution for smaller companys. For example an adobe Acrobat light edition which is affordable for most people. Thx for reading my reply</description>

		<description>It’s good that you’re spreading out to all of Adobe’s products, but Dreamweaver still needs a lot of work to make it encourage people to use web-standards. I gave up using it when I discovered standards as it just makes things more complicated.</description>

		<description>Including HomeSite is a good idea. Where can we apply for that? Hand Coding is still the cherry on the top of a good code.</description>

		<description>This is terrific news!  I agree with may others sentiments on here but I think that maybe we haven&#039;t all been using the same DW?  I&#039;ve been teaching DW CS3 for a year now and its nothing but great for creating valid markup with very little necessity to hand code (which I have done since 1998).  So I am not sure where the disconnect is.  Maybe its in user training? Maybe folks just don&#039;t know the power thats already built into DW?</description>

		<description>Best wishes for a productive endeavor…if you can include HomeSite, that would be even more exciting for those of us handcoders who still love our favorite tool.</description>

		<description>is there any non-obvious reason why my previous comment bemoaning the
lack of flashplayer for THE quintessential internet OS&#039;s, namely the BSD
derivatives, was removed ?
(free/net/open/dragonfly)
what use are webstandards when you can sit there with standards compliant
browser, fast and capable hardware and software that makes it work, and
still be unable to view a large proportion of the available content that&#039;s out there,
with many sites being completely unusable ?
am I assuming too much when I assume &quot;open&quot; and &quot;accessible&quot;
when the term &quot;web standards&quot; is mentioned ?
this is very much on-topic for this announcement.
any insight or comments gratefully received.</description>

		<description>Nice to see it&#039;s still rolling on, but let&#039;s get a few things clear..

Homesite 5 (not the + version) needs to be brought back...i use it in Vista x64 it craps out a few times in a day. VS2005 or 2008 don&#039;t cut the formatting for classic ASP.

Please please please make this an agenda....hope Jeff is still on the team...

Long live Homesite i guess i could use DW and only code view...but it&#039;s a bit clunky.

Many thanks

		<description>This should be a really good move for Adobe.  As others have commented there are some issues that need to be addressed, but for the most part I am happy with all of Adobe&#039;s current programs.  I am not a professional designer/coder by any means but I use Dreamweaver to build up sites for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.experienced-people.co.uk/5002-home-based-business-ideas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;home business&lt;/a&gt;.  While I do have to go through and clean up code here and there, I am happy with its features.  Hopefully the new Adobe Task Force will be able to take care of some of these issues and create an all around better software.</description>
