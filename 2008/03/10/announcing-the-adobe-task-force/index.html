			<p>The Web Standards Project Dreamweaver Task Force was created in 2001 to accomplish two tasks: to work with Macromedia (later Adobe) to improve the standards compliance and accessibility of Web pages produced with Dreamweaver and to communicate effectively within the online Dreamweaver community.  Having successfully completed its initial goals, WaSP announces that the Dreamweaver Task Force will be renamed the <strong>Adobe Task Force</strong> to reflect a widened scope. The Adobe Task Force will collaborate with Adobe on all of the company’s products that output code or content to the Web, and will continue to advocate compliance with Web Standards and accessibility guidelines by those who use Adobe’s products to design and build Web sites and applications.  <a href="/press/releases/20080310/index.html">Read the press release to learn more.</a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re spreading out to all of Adobe&#8217;s products, but Dreamweaver still needs <em>a lot</em> of work to make it encourage people to use web-standards. I gave up using it when I discovered standards as it just makes things more complicated.</p>

												<p>I&#8217;m also glad to see that this work continues&#8211;many thanks to those who are actively involved from those of us who aren&#8217;t&#8211;however, I am very sorry to see (or not see!) HomeSite included in the list of Adobe products included in this initiative.</p>
<p>Dreamweaver, while very good in many ways, just doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to HomeSite in terms of code control, code cleanliness and speed of production.  I have felt for quite some time that Adobe is overlooking a marvellous product that could easily rival newer comers like Eclipse, Aptana, etc.&#8211;if only Adobe cared.  HomeSite doesn&#8217;t cost as much as DW, so I can see why it&#8217;s not included (from a pure profit motive point of view), but if updated with &#8220;all the latest&#8221; in frameworks, AJAX, AIR, etc. and still kept lean and mean, HomeSite could be a real addition to Adobe&#8217;s lineup&#8230;and a real addition to the world of web standards.</p>
<p>Best wishes for a productive endeavor&#8230;if you can include HomeSite, that would be even more exciting for those of us handcoders who still love our favorite tool.</p>

												<p>Great to hear the initiative still has movement; I agree that Dreamweaver&#8217;s code is atrocious (and I spend money training all my new hires away from it), but I&#8217;d say Photoshop&#8217;s template output might be equal in horror if not worse. You have the choice of a divitis cocktail or a table based mix&#8230; and they&#8217;re not that pretty to begin with. Regardless, I hope it works out, and always happy to help here in SF if they have questions.</p>

												<p>Acrobat<br />
The big program that Adobe need to sort out on the web is Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat.<br />
The problem is that instead of putting text in HTML they put it in an PDF which is really annoying if you have to open up the program like 5 times.<br />
Acrobat is Ok if you are accessing a document that needs to use a PDF file say a scanned in file but with CSS you can make a document look as good. It is the amount of files that do not need to use PDF files and do use them.</p>
<p>Flash<br />
Flash is a program which is good but not good if you are accessing a website from a browser that does not have flash you have a problem.<br />
The problem is if you have a small budget, the software to do any kind of Flash code considering the Program costs tremendous amounts of money.<br />
There is also no way to turn flash programs of! If you do not want to watch flash programs they have no way to actually stop their own program.<br />
Flash has much advantages such as you can use any shape textbox or create your own and being an artist it is a program very desirable!</p>

												<p>This should be a really good move for Adobe.  As others have commented there are some issues that need to be addressed, but for the most part I am happy with all of Adobe&#8217;s current programs.  I am not a professional designer/coder by any means but I use Dreamweaver to build up sites for my <a href="http://www.experienced-people.co.uk/5002-home-based-business-ideas/" rel="nofollow">home business</a>.  While I do have to go through and clean up code here and there, I am happy with its features.  Hopefully the new Adobe Task Force will be able to take care of some of these issues and create an all around better software.</p>

												<p>Nice to see it&#8217;s still rolling on, but let&#8217;s get a few things clear..</p>
<p>Homesite 5 (not the + version) needs to be brought back&#8230;i use it in Vista x64 it craps out a few times in a day. VS2005 or 2008 don&#8217;t cut the formatting for classic ASP.</p>
<p>Please please please make this an agenda&#8230;.hope Jeff is still on the team&#8230;</p>
<p>Long live Homesite i guess i could use DW and only code view&#8230;but it&#8217;s a bit clunky.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

												<p>is there any non-obvious reason why my previous comment bemoaning the<br />
lack of flashplayer for THE quintessential internet OS&#8217;s, namely the BSD<br />
derivatives, was removed ?<br />
(free/net/open/dragonfly)<br />
what use are webstandards when you can sit there with standards compliant<br />
browser, fast and capable hardware and software that makes it work, and<br />
still be unable to view a large proportion of the available content that&#8217;s out there,<br />
with many sites being completely unusable ?<br />
am I assuming too much when I assume &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;accessible&#8221;<br />
when the term &#8220;web standards&#8221; is mentioned ?<br />
this is very much on-topic for this announcement.<br />
any insight or comments gratefully received.</p>

												<p>Best wishes for a productive endeavor…if you can include HomeSite, that would be even more exciting for those of us handcoders who still love our favorite tool.</p>

												<p>This is terrific news!  I agree with may others sentiments on here but I think that maybe we haven&#8217;t all been using the same DW?  I&#8217;ve been teaching DW CS3 for a year now and its nothing but great for creating valid markup with very little necessity to hand code (which I have done since 1998).  So I am not sure where the disconnect is.  Maybe its in user training? Maybe folks just don&#8217;t know the power thats already built into DW?</p>

												<p>Including HomeSite is a good idea. Where can we apply for that? Hand Coding is still the cherry on the top of a good code.</p>

												<p>It’s good that you’re spreading out to all of Adobe’s products, but Dreamweaver still needs a lot of work to make it encourage people to use web-standards. I gave up using it when I discovered standards as it just makes things more complicated.</p>

												<p>Ok, hi @ all. I think that Adobe Reader should get some more little functions. Maybe extracted from Adobe Acrobat. I have to work everyday with this &#8220;good job&#8221; application. There are so many people who need to work everyday with this freeware tool produced by adobe, but i think that there are some missing parts which should be included in the Reader. At the very least, Adobe should create a small business solution for smaller companys. For example an adobe Acrobat light edition which is affordable for most people. Thx for reading my reply</p>
