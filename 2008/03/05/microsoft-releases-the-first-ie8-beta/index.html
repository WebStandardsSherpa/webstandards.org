												<p>Well, all of my sites have problems with IE8 but worked in all other browsers (IE6/7 with conditional comments).  Google maps blow up in size.  Navbars are chopped up or don&#8217;t work at all.  And that&#8217;s what I found after just five minutes of browsing.</p>

												<p>It replaces IE7, but IE8 includes a full copy of the IE7 rendering engine.  There&#8217;s an &#8220;Emulate IE7&#8243; button that in theory should display sites *exactly* the same as the previous version.</p>
<p>It requires closing all IE windows to switch modes (I guess auto-switching is for a later beta), so I haven&#8217;t tried it yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m posting my <a href="http://www.hyperborea.org/journal/archives/2008/03/05/ie8-b1/" rel="nofollow">first impressions of the beta</a> over at my blog, and will probably add to that entry as I notice more good/bad/interesting issues.</p>

												<p>Yes, it will overwrite your IE7. I&#8217;d say this first beta is too unstable to use as a main browser yet &#8211; but it is a first beta, so entirely fair enough IMO.</p>
<p>Acid2 works for me in IE8.</p>

												<p>You can use the Developer Tools feature to switch rendering modes during run-time, although I have noticed *very* subtle differences on a few pages when comparing the &#8220;reload IE&#8221; emulation with the &#8220;select this menu item&#8221; emulation. I&#8217;m guessing they haven&#8217;t perfected that part yet, but it does come very, very close.</p>
<p>Simply press SHIFT+F12 to get the Developer Tools window, and select the rendering mode in View &gt; Change Compatibility Mode. You can even choose to show the current page in quirks mode that way. I&#8217;m not sure if that works as intended when Emulate IE7 is turned on, though &#8211; haven&#8217;t tried it.</p>

												<p>I support &#8220;Internet democracy&#8221; all the way, but man, as a web developer in the learning process, I wish there was one big monopolic browser in which everything just worked!</p>

												<p>&#8220;Google maps blow up in size. Navbars are chopped up or don’t work at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, I&#8217;m seeing the exact same issues, pretty much every site I have ever built is falling apart, its look like &#8220;hasLayout&#8221; or the lack of it is still causing problems, and what is that with google maps? The map is filling the entire page&#8230;</p>
<p>Not to mention that some of my javascript is either not working or is not working as it should.</p>
<p>I think the IE team still have plenty of work to do before they can call IE8 standards compliant.</p>

												<p>Strange, it didn&#8217;t even pass the ACID2 for me under Vista, though infinitely better than IE7 does in the test.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m also seeing a lot of glitches. It messes up the main navigation of webstandards.org for example. And on some pages it won&#8217;t let me type anything in forms.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a first beta after all, so I guess (certainly hope) we&#8217;ll see a lot of improvement.</p>

												<p>To run IE8 side-by-side with your current browser, use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">Virtual PC image</a>.</p>

												<p>IE8 didn&#8217;t cheat the ACID2 test.  It currently doesn&#8217;t permit fallback if the OBJECT tag points to a location that it will not navigate to due to security reasons, e.g. cross domain.  The official ACID2 doesn&#8217;t attempt to link across domains so it works fine.  The acidtests.org version does, so it refuses to attempt to connect therefore cannot receive the 404 error necessary for the fallback scenario.  If the acidtests.org version used a URL in their domain, or even a relative path, it would work just fine.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the standard has anything to say about this behavior.  People are arguing that in the case that IE8 refuses to navigate to a URI that it should use the fallback behavior anyway, which would render ACID2 correctly on acidtests.org.  That is probably not a bad idea but this is something probably not covered by the standards.</p>
<p>Speaking of standards, I know people talk about IE8 passing ACID2 (when the above situation is not cross domains), however I noticed that the hover on the nose div behaves differently on IE8 than in Opera.  The nose stops being highlighted if the mouse moves anywhere below the two triangles that make up the nose, rather than anywhere within the div.  Is this right or does IE8 need to be tweaked in order to &#8220;truely&#8221; pass?</p>

												<p>Nathan/Rob &#8211; it&#8217;s beta 1.  They&#8217;ve stated that full CSS 2.1 compliance is the goal for the &#8220;final&#8221; release.  So I expect that there are still a number of features that they haven&#8217;t implemented yet, let alone bugs fixed.</p>

												<p>Is this strange? IE8 passes for me on the first load, but has bad results on a reload, but only for a second or two. It looks for those couple of seconds like it does on <a href="http://acid2.acidtests.org/" rel="nofollow">acid2.acidtests.org</a> (link for ie8 only). Also, when I refresh on Safari 3, the acid2 test screws up in the same place, but without scroll bars. The same in Opera 9. The only one that doesn&#8217;t show that glitch is FireFox 3.</p>

												<p>So now the other shoe drops. </p>
<p>MS has shifted it&#8217;s &#8220;embrace, extend and extinguish&#8221; and anti-competitive strategies from the actual webpages to additional browser features like &#8216;Activities&#8217; an &#8216;WebSlices&#8217;. </p>
<p>However, with this in mind, I am now assured MS will make every effort to make IE8 a decently standards compliant browser with no tricks up its sleeve as far as rendering HTML/CSS is concerned. They&#8217;ve found another angle to fuck over the competition, one that is not yet covered by existing anti-trust investigations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we have a Microformats standards war on our hands, and the whole thing starts all over again. </p>
<p>This of course will be completed by issues around patents (can other apps/browsers implement this without becoming MS&#8217; bitches?) and anti-trust issues if MS actually has the gal to push IE8 with stuff like Live Maps set up by default as an update.</p>
<p>Meet the new Microsoft, same as the old Microsoft.</p>

												<p>Whats the point? Whats the point of making a test then not beingable to see what browsers have passed it or has not or has passed by what percent. </p>
<p>If you make a test like the Acid 3 test then put out information about what browsers have or not passed it and why. </p>
<p>I can put out a Acid 4 Ultra Test, but with out knowning what browsers have been tested and what there results are the test is meaningless.</p>

												<p>I may wait until they have sorted out the bugs to download it, alot of people on the web are still using Ie6 to change people to ie8 will take alot of work!<br />
The reason is that many people in the foriegn world such as India still use Windows 98 and lower. The reason people may not be changing as the browser is only for Windows Xp and up<br />
it will be good to use things such as fixed positioning without have to worry about which browser it is,<br />

												<p>Nice effort, i am really happy that a new version is on its way. What IE8 hopefully will be, is what IE7 supposed to be (at least in hope of webdevelopers &#8211; hehe). It will be quite interesting to have 3 different versions of the same browser on the market. . </p>
<p>A lot of things are not working or functioning badly &#8211; javascript, cursor navigation and content selection, IE7 reendering mode has enough quirks, web developer toolbar has its own behavior, new empty tabs appear with javascript errors and so on anyway i am downgrading back after reviewing it and checking out my sites.</p>
<p>But hey, i do understand that its just a beta &#8211; and i am grateful, that we can all take a look at it. =O)</p>
<p>p.s. written using IE8 &#8211; content selection and navigation is the real pain in the arse.</p>

												<p>@Dominic Shiells &#8212; The reason why IE6 is so prevalent is not because of Windows 98 or even 2000 (which can&#8217;t run IE7).  It&#8217;s because IE7 was a very disruptive release that broke lots of websites and intranet apps.</p>
<p>The original IE8 versioning plan looked to prevent this by ensuring that any sites/apps that worked with IE7 would continue to work identically in IE8.  That is no longer the case, so I&#8217;d say that the transition to IE8 will be just as long and slow as the IE7 transition.</p>
<p>Chris Wilson has stated that the layout engine in IE8 is all-new, so I would guess that the severity of breakage with IE8 would be much higher than what IE7 broke.  The good thing is that this time, unlike with IE6, the IE7 meta tag will allow quick fixing, rather than having to go and fix all the real underyling bugs.  This may make deployment of IE8 go smoother than IE7&#8242;s.</p>

												<p>Keith, with some of the javascript language changes &#8216;break&#8217; goes beyond a box model change that puts padding outside instead of inside. Cases like &#8216;document.getElementBy Id()&#8217; not returning the element because the author had used the name attribute is one easy example that comes to mind. [and yes, i realie this would already fail in 'other' browsers already, but its just an example].</p>
<p>Its also not just &#8220;the web&#8221; that is a concern to MS&#8230; many intranet or other browser based applications may have been coded poorly because their developers felt like they were working in a vendor controlled ecosystem who may have coded to IE6 or IE7 features [document.all, getelementby id, events system, other js quirks].</p>
<p>So as a vendor I think its understandable for MS to be worried about impact of upgrades, but the situation they&#8217;re &#8216;creating&#8217; isn&#8217;t all that new to the world of browser releases.</p>

												<p>Dear WaSP, plase file a bug that reminds the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE developers, that CSS files that aren&#8217;t labeld with the media type &#8220;<code>text/css</code>&#8221; must be ignored.</p>
<p>This is important, because Acid3 will make the remaining engines fix this bug. So if this isn&#8217;t fixed in Internet Explorer, it will lead to interoperability problems.</abbr></p>
