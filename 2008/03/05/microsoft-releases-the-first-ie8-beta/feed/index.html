		<description>I have been waiting for IE8 for such a long time... However, it was such a shock when I first load my site on it today: CSS looks not right, AJAX (prototype) broke down ..... But, I don&#039;t believe I am the only one suffering it! 

If you have a look at Facebook, Flickr, My Yahoo, you will soon find out they are experiencing the bloody same problems! IE guys, what the hell you doing? Try to get all developer put &quot;Don&#039;t support IE, please use Firefox or Safari or....&quot;?</description>

		<description>Ie8 very good, very strong. In particular the &quot;imitation IE7&quot; function. Open new tab significantly faster than before.</description>

		<description>And I don&#039;t know why people still even use Ie at all. It pisses me off that I have to hack my designs to make &quot;separate&quot; instructions for individual version of IE.</description>

		<description>It doesn&#039;t matter if IE8 replaces previous Ie&#039;s. It can emulate IE7, and you can install a program called &quot;multiple ies&quot; that lets to run 4, 5, 5.5, and 6 along side something past 6 (7 or 8).</description>

		<description>IE8 Won&#039;t even launch on my computer. It crashes each time upon startup.</description>

		<description>Dear WaSP, plase file a bug that reminds the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Internet Explorer&quot;&gt;IE developers, that CSS files that aren&#039;t labeld with the media type &quot;&lt;code&gt;text/css&lt;/code&gt;&quot; must be ignored.

This is important, because Acid3 will make the remaining engines fix this bug. So if this isn&#039;t fixed in Internet Explorer, it will lead to interoperability problems.&lt;/abbr&gt;</description>

		<description>Keith, with some of the javascript language changes &#039;break&#039; goes beyond a box model change that puts padding outside instead of inside. Cases like &#039;document.getElementBy Id()&#039; not returning the element because the author had used the name attribute is one easy example that comes to mind. [and yes, i realie this would already fail in &#039;other&#039; browsers already, but its just an example].

Its also not just &quot;the web&quot; that is a concern to MS... many intranet or other browser based applications may have been coded poorly because their developers felt like they were working in a vendor controlled ecosystem who may have coded to IE6 or IE7 features [document.all, getelementby id, events system, other js quirks].

So as a vendor I think its understandable for MS to be worried about impact of upgrades, but the situation they&#039;re &#039;creating&#039; isn&#039;t all that new to the world of browser releases.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t know about this whole web-site breaking thing.  I&#039;m assuming mostly minor issues.  Do people really care about minor presentational problems?  It seems like much ado about nothing to me.</description>

		<description>Not sure if anyone else has noticed this with IE8 .....

Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Windows Update

Microsoft tells you that you need a version of IE higher than 5.

I&#039;m still scratching my head.</description>
