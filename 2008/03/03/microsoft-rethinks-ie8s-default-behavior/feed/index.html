		<description>I really cannot wait for Microsoft to start competing with Firefox again. I&#039;ve just downloaded the Beta for IE8 and am expecting some &lt;strong&gt;significant improvement&lt;/strong&gt; on IE7. All I noticed from IE6 to IE7 was a cosmetic difference that was probably made to fit in with Vista&#039;s look &amp; feel. Better client-side scripting support is what i&#039;m looking for primarily. Widespread CSS support between all new browsers would be great but that would mean there is lesser competition between browsers. If Silverlight takes off and IE8 has made significant improvements, it seems that for &lt;strong&gt;web designers and developers&lt;/strong&gt; like myself, we may have to once again endorse &lt;strong&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#039;ll let you guys know what I think of IE8.</description>

		<description>[...] Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 releasedMicrosoft released the first beta of Internet Explorer 8. Among new features the integration of pseudo-classes :after and :before. IE8 improves rendering of content authored to various web standards in standards mode. The new version features an enhanced and standardized DOM that brings it in line with implementations in other browsers. Additionally, IE8 has dramatically enhanced AJAX support with features like DOM: Storage, Cross Document Messaging (XDM) and the Selectors APIs. And (hurrah, hurrah): IE8 will use Standards mode by default. Details, comments, analysis and ideas. And, finally, IE8 Readiness Toolkit for web-developers. [...]</description>

		<description>I think that this is a really important announcement from Microsoft and will certainly promote a more standards compliant web, which is sorely needed.

We have recently conducted some research into just how many web sites adhere to technical standards and legal requirements. The findings are fairly grim!

		<description>Considering the widespread penetration of Windows and related applications, wouldn&#039;t it be nice if Microsoft helped by joining in on the Outreach and Education aspect of standards and informed its own consumers about the changes?

MS could do so with software or application updates and helpful reminders or tips in its applications. MS could also offer up resources and pointers about where to find more information about Web standards.

It would make standards advocacy work a lot easier, and adoption of standards move ahead.</description>

		<description>Hi,

I just read the announcement on the blog. It doesn&#039;t seem to say anything about the support for XHTML.

Many people suggest that if the browser is strictly going to follow the standards (HTML 4.01 Strict), it becomes secondary that whether it will truly support XHTML or not, because forcing the browsers to follow the standards was one of the most important goals of creating XHTML.

However, I believe that if IE 8 doesn&#039;t implement XHTML, there is no guarantee that it will never again move away from the web standards in the future. I kinda feel that XHTML can lock MS with the standards and that is why they have tried to avoid true implementation of XHTML.</description>
