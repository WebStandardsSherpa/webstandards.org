		<description>I&#039;m not convinced that Mozilla will get a 100/100 score in the next couple of years. While the Gecko-Engine improves from version to version, the ACID3 test checks, among others, the correct implementation of &quot;CSS2 (@font-face)&quot;.

This includes the support of the &quot;src&quot; parameter to specify a dynamically loadable font-file.

You did note that this is a CSS2 feature, did you? A specification that dates back to 1998.

As Netscape released the Source of the browser back in 1998, the community had to remove the support for dynamically loaded fonts due to copyright-issues. It&#039;s a long lasting and unresolved bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52746, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70132) with no hint of progress in the mean time.

The licenses of the font vendors obviously require a &quot;closed source&quot; implementation and the Mozilla license obviously prohibits just that - the utilisation of a closed source library. A classical deadlock.

We had the 10th aniversary of this unfortune happening lately.

Maybe the OpenType specification and a set of public domain fonts can solve this issue one day.</description>

		<description>Firefox 3 Beta 5 scores 71/100 on ACID3, which is better than Beta 4, which was 67 if memory serves me.

I was hoping to see the various squares turn different colors, rather than shades of gray.  I hope this will be fixed in time for the official release.

There are also a few artifacts (2 small red squares, white X against a magenta background).

I&#039;m glad to see improvements being made.  It&#039;s only a matter of time.</description>

		<description>Reposting:

OS X.4.11

Webkit Nightly Build (r31307) (with Safari 3.1 installed, but not used) now gets 96/100

They’ve also just introduced an optimization into Webkit nightlies for pageloading that is very sweet on script heavy pages.
http://webkit.org/blog/166/optimizing-page-loading-in-web-browser/

“The latest WebKit nightlies contain some new optimizations to reduce the impact of network latency. When script loading halts the main parser, we start up a side parser that goes through the rest of the HTML source to find more resources to load. We also prioritize resources so that scripts and stylesheets load before images. The overall effect is that we are now able to load more resources in parallel with scripts, including other scripts.”</description>
