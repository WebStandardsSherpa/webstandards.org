		<description>If web developers abide to accessibility guidelines, then more people with disabilities will be able access the web to a fuller extent. Sometimes, its not just about moving forward.... look around at those who still need help!</description>

		<description>It would be nice if web developers did have to abide by accessibility guidelines by law.  Then we could sue all the web sites that use CAPTCHA.  FTW!</description>

		<description>Just another consequence of the importance of cyberspace. Not allowing access to a major web site really does, I supppose, amount to discrimination now.</description>

		<description>Actually, Brice, the standard in court would not be the knowledge of the developer but the degree of disadvantage experienced by the disabled plaintiff. By that reasoning, an architect who (somehow) did not know how to make a building entrance wheelchair-accessible could never be challenged under antidiscrimination law. Ignorance of the law is, as they say, no excuse.</description>

		<description>This may help raise awareness of web accessibility as being a legal issue in some circumstances but unfortunately I think that having promoted the approach of fixing the problems before being taken to court for some years now, I see very little sign that anyone is taking any notice. I suspect that it will take a number of high profile court cases before there is a shift in attitude. 
In the UK where the disability discrimination act is pretty clear on the requirement for accessible web sites (and has been so for the past nine years) there is still only very small dents being made in the problem.</description>
