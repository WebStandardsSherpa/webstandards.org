		<description>Steve, I think petitions do have an influence on whether they reopen it. The point is that the more people show interest the more the likelihood raises to reopen the institute. On the other hand I totally agree with you. There has to be found an investor, hence the denunciation of what happens now is very important. I&#039;d also appreciate donations.</description>

		<description>The University of Texas at Austin&#039;s Accessibility Institute has been one of the most important organizations in the *world* regarding promoting accessibility in technology. It has been an organization that has greatly influenced the lives and work of many.
This is a chance to take a stand and say that tech accessibility for people with disabilities remains a burning issue and a major part of battling the Digital Divide.</description>

		<description>As technology rapidly changes, current accessibility standards continue to evolve. Research-based practices must be developed, implemented and evaluated. Accessibility leaders from all over the world look to UT as an exemplar. At a time when governments are trying to establish equitable standards and businesses are seeking to include all markets in their messaging and services, UT can not stand down from this important work.

Please dedicate the resources necessary to maintain and build on Universal Design theories and practices pioneered by John Slatin at the Accessibility Institute.</description>
